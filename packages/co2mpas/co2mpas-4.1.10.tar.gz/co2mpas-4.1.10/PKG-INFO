Description: 
        What is CO_2MPAS?
        *****************
        
        CO_2MPAS is backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO_2 and
        fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 & N1 vehicles (cars and
        vans), specially crafted to *estimate the CO2 emissions of vehicles
        undergoing NEDC* testing based on the emissions produced *WLTP
        testing* during type-approval, according to the EU legislations
        *1152/EUR/2017 and 1153/EUR/2017* (see `History`_ section, below).
        
        It is an open-source project (`EUPL 1.1+
        <https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl>`_) developed for
        Python-3.6+. It runs either as a *console command* or as a *desktop
        GUI application*, and it uses Excel-files or pure python structures
        (dictionary and lists) for its input & output data.
        
        
        History
        =======
        
        The *European Commission* has introduced the *WLTP* as the test
        procedure for the type I test of the European type-approval of
        Light-duty vehicles as of September 2017. Its introduction has
        required the adaptation of CO_2 certification and monitoring
        procedures set by European regulations (443/2009, 510/2011,
        1152/EUR/2017 and 1153/EUR/2017). European Commissionâ€™s *Joint
        Research Centre* (JRC) has been assigned the development of this
        vehicle simulator to facilitate this adaptation.
        
        The European Regulation setting the conditions for using CO_2MPAS can
        be found in `the Comitology Register
        <http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.documentdetail&dos_id=0&ds_id=45835&version=2>`_
        after its adoption by the *Climate Change Committee* which took place
        on June 23, 2016, and its 2nd vote for modifications, in April 27,
        2017.
        
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        To install CO_2MPAS use (with root privileges):
        
        ::
        
           $ pip install co2mpas
        
        Or download the latest git version and use (with root privileges):
        
        ::
        
           $ python setup.py install
        
        Some additional functionality is enabled installing the following
        extras:
        
        * ``cli``: enables the command line interface.
        
        * ``sync``: enables the time series synchronization tool (i.e.,
           `syncing <https://github.com/vinci1it2000/syncing>`_ previously
           named ``datasync``).
        
        * ``gui``: enables the graphical user interface.
        
        * ``plot``: enables to plot the CO_2MPAS model and the workflow of
           each run.
        
        * ``io``: enables to read/write excel files.
        
        * ``dice``: enables the Type Approval mode.
        
        * ``driver``: enables the driver model (currently is not available).
        
        To install co2mpas and all extras, do:
        
        ::
        
           $ pip install co2mpas[all]
