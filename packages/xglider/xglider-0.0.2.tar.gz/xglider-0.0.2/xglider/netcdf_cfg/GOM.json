    "summary": "The overarching goal of Spray underwater glider operations in the Gulf of Mexico was to improve dynamical knowledge of oceanographic conditions in the Loop Current and associated eddies.  A specific objective was to provide data to data assimilating models to establish the predictability of currents in the region.",
