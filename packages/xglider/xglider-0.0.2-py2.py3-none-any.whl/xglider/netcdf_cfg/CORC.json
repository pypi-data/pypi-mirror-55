    "summary": "CORC (Consortium on the Ocean's Role in Climate) has been making observations of the California Current systems with moorings since 2008. In support of these mooring deployments, gliders have been used that serve as data shuttles to communicate with the underwater mooring gear, as well as collect additional data near or between the moorings. These glider operations are done by PI U. Send, and are in addition to repeat glider sections by PI D. Rudnick in the same general area. Glider data reported here are temperature and salinity, as well as column-average currents based on lateral glider displacement between dives.",
