European NACE partner categories
================================

This module imports the NACE rev. 2 classification
categories as partner categories in 23 languages, courtesy of the EU.

The *Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community*
commonly referred to as NACE, is a European industry standard classification
system using a 6 digit code.

NACE is equivalent to the SIC and NAICS system:

* Standard Industrial Classification
* North American Industry Classification System.

This module is a rewrite of the older community module "partner_nace" from
the former `extra-addons` repository of Odoo v5 (called OpenERP at the time).

Usage
=====

Each NACE code is represented by a partner category.

Once this module is installed, you can assign NACE categories to your partners
by simply adding the corresponding category in the partner's form.

Obtaining updated data
======================

The data imported into Odoo is generated from the files downloaded
from the RAMON service::

  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_CLS_DLD&StrNom=NACE_REV2&StrLanguageCode=FR&StrLayoutCode=#

If you want to update the data or add another translation, download the
corresponding file from RAMON in CSV format, using ',' as a separator.
Save it to the directory "data" and name it according to the language
code::

  NACE_REV2_<language code>.csv

Then update the LANGS constant in the script "make_data.py" and run it to
refresh the OpenERP data files. Finally, upgrade the module to load the data.
