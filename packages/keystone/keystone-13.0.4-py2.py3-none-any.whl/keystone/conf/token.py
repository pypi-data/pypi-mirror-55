it if present), whereas `required` will always demand tokens to having binding

reducing this value may break "long-running" operations that involve multiple

keystone more frequently. Drastically increasing this value will increase load

potential security impact of a compromised token.

providers. `uuid` tokens must be persisted (using the backend specified in the
`[token] driver` option), but do not require any extra configuration or setup.
