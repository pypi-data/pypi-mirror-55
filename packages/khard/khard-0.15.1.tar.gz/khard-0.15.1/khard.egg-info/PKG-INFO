Description: khard
        =====
        
        Khard is an address book for the Linux console. It creates, reads, modifies and
        removes carddav address book entries at your local machine. Khard is also
        compatible to the email clients mutt and alot and the SIP client twinkle. You
        can find more information about khard and the whole synchronization process
        [here](http://eric-scheibler.de/en/blog/2014/10/Sync-calendars-and-address-books-between-Linux-and-Android/).
        
        Warning: If you want to create or modify contacts with khard, beware that the
        vcard standard is very inconsistent and lacks interoperability. Different
        actors in that sector have defined their own extensions and even produce
        non-standard output. A good example is the type value, which is tied to phone
        numbers, email and post addresses. Khard tries to avoid such incompatibilities
        but if you sync your contacts with an Android or iOS device, expect problems.
        You are on the safe side, if you only use khard to read contacts. For further
        information about the vcard compatibility issues have a look into [this blog
        post](http://alessandrorossini.org/2012/11/15/the-sad-story-of-the-vcard-format-and-its-lack-of-interoperability/).
