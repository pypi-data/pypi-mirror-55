Prasopes
========

Prasopes is a free and open source Thermo/Finnigan .RAW spectra viewer. It is an implementation example of the rawFin library. Its limitation in means of the supported format scope is defined by the current developemnt state of the rawFin library.

## Installation

Install using the command bellow. Remove --user from command if You want to
install the application into system directory.

Linux:

```
python3 setup.py install --user
```

Windows:
```
pip install PyQt5

PyQt5 and PyQt5-sip .egg packages are broken, if you will initiate installation by python3 setup.py the whole process will fail (at least true at 2018-09-16). If you install them by pip install valid .whl packages are downloaded instead and everything works as it should. If you accidentaly installed abovementioned .egg packages please remove them and proceed as stated below.
