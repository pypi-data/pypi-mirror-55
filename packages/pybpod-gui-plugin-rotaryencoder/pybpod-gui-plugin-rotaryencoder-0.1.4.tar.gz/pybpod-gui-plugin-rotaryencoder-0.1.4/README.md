# What is the PyBpodâ€™s Rotary Encoder Module?

The Rotary Encoder Module is a board developed by [Sanworks](https://sanworks.io/), to record and analyze rotational movements from a motor.

This repository is for the Python 3 library named **pybpod_rotaryencoder_module** that works with [PyBpod](https://github.com/pybpod/pybpod).

The module allows to control and configure the Rotary Encoder module from [Sanworks](https://sanworks.io/shop/viewproduct?productID=1022). This can be done using the UI available in the module, as a [PyBpod](https://github.com/pybpod/pybpod) plugin or using the API for that purpose.

# Documentation

At the moment the documentation is available at: https://pybpod.readthedocs.io/projects/pybpod-gui-plugin-rotaryencoder/

The documentation includes examples, the available API and a usage description of the UI.
