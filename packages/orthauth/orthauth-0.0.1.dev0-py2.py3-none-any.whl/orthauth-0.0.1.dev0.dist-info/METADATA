# orthauth
A library to dissociate authentication from program logic.

# THIS IS NOT A SECURE
# THIS IS NOT ENCRYPTED
# THIS IS NOT A PASSWORD MANAGER
# YOU CAN SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT WITH THIS
There is **NO encryption** for secrets stored using orthauth.
Orthauth can source credientials from a variety of sources
but it is **INTENTIONALLY INSECURE**.

If you do not understand the [Use case](#use-case) for this as well as the
risks if used outside a secure environment then DO NOT USE IT.
No one can help you if you get pwnd.

## Use case
`orthauth` is indented to unify two common ways managing credentials:
setting them environment variables, and including them in a plain text
file with permissions set to `0600` (and preferably kept in a folder
set to `0700`).

For example running a program in the following way
`export API_KEY=lolplzdonotstealthis; ./my-script-that-needs-the-key`
or using a file like `~/.pgpass` or emacs `.authinfo`. Note that
pgpass probably shouldn't be a source for most python implementations
because libraries like psycopg2 are able to read it directly. However in
other languages that do not have a library that supports reading from pgpass
directly, then pgpass would be a useful source.

By making it possible to provide credentials seemlessley in multiple ways
the hope is to reduce the use of different solutions in different environments
without incuring the massive complexity of maintaining a managed authentication
infrasturcture.

## Approach
1. Decorators  
2. A layer or two of indirection between names in a code base and the content of secrets.
3. Extremely clear about what should be considered public information. Thus prevent anything
stored as a secret from being used as a key to find another secret.
