Description: # Reasy
        
        A crawler for BT7086 and fast and simple m3u8 downloader.
        
        ## Get Start
        
        Download and install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) and [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), both of them are the key components for Reasy.
        
        Install Reasy. Sometimes you may use `pip3` instead of `pip`, and it also works for `python3` which will be used later on. When you got `reasy version 0.0.4`, it means installation is succeed.
        
        ```bash
        pip install reasy
        reasy -v
        ```
        
        Set environment variable for Reasy.
        
        - REASY_CONFIG: The path for config of Reasy. Please move `config.yaml.example` to the config folder and rename it to `config.yaml`. To make clear, I presume you move it into `/.reasy/config.yaml`.
        
        ```bash
        # Linux
        export REASY_CONFIG=/.reasy/config.yaml
        ```
        
        Change config.yaml to meet your requirements. Here we go:
        
        - aria2.config: This is for Aria2, a light-weight downloader. You can use `aria2.conf.example` as template.
        - aria2.download_path: The path your videos are saved.
        - session.enabled: A mechanism to prevent from download repeated. Unless you know what it is, you should enable it as default.
        - session.path: The path for session file. You just need to create a empty file by `touch /.reasy/reasy.session`.
        
        For now, you can run and enjoy it.
        
        ```bash
        reasy run
        # for more usage
        reasy run --help
        ```
        
        ## Not Implement Yet
