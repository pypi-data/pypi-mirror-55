    """
    Pushed workbooks into Seeq using a list of Workbook object definitions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    workbooks : list[Workbook]
        A list containing Workbook objects to be pushed into Seeq.

    path : str, default None
        A '>>'-delimited folder path to create to contain the workbooks. Note
        that a further subfolder hierarchy will be created to preserve the
        relative paths that the folders were in when they were searched for
        and pulled.

    label : str, default None
        A user-defined label that differentiates this push operation from
        others. Use this argument when you (or someone else) has already pushed
        a particular set of workbooks and you want to push a new copy of them.

    datasource_map_folder : str, default None
        A folder containing Datasource_Map_Xxxx_Yyyy_Zzzz.json files that can
        provides a means to map stored items (i.e., those originating from
        external datasources like OSIsoft PI) from one server to another. A
        default set of datasource map files is created during a pull/save
        sequence, and you can copy these default files to a folder, alter them,
        and then specify the folder as this argument.

    use_full_path : bool, default False
        If True, the original full path for an item is reconstructed, as
        opposed to the path that is relative to the Path property supplied to
        the spy.workbooks.search() call that originally helped create these
        workbook definitions. Note that this full path will still be inside
        the folder specified by the 'path' argument, if supplied.

    owner : str, default spy.workbook.PRESERVE_OWNER
        Determines the ownership of pushed workbooks and folders.

        By default, the current owner will be preserved. If the content doesn't
        exist yet, the logged-in user will be the owner.

        All other options require that the logged-in user is an admin:

        If spy.workbook.ORIGINAL_OWNER, ownership is assigned according to the
        original owner of the pulled content.

        If spy.workbook.FORCE_ME_AS_OWNER, existing content will be
        reassigned to the logged-in user.

        If a username or a user's Seeq ID is supplied, that user will be
        assigned as owner.

        You may need to supply an appropriate datasource map if the usernames
        are different between the original and the target servers.

    access_control : str, default None
        Specifies of Access Control Lists should be treated, via the
        following keywords: add/replace,loose/strict

        If None, then no access control entries are pushed.
        If 'add', then existing access control entries will not be disturbed
          but new entries will be added.
        If 'replace', then existing access control entries will be removed
          and replaced with the entries from workbook definitions.

        If 'loose', then any unmapped users/groups from the workbook
          definitions will be silently ignored.
        If 'strict', then any unmapped users/groups will result in errors.

        Example: access_control='replace,loose'

    override_max_interp : bool, default False
        If True, then the Maximum Interpolation overrides from the source
        system will be written to the destination system.

    errors: {'raise', 'catalog'}, default 'raise'
        If 'raise', any errors encountered will cause an exception. If
        'catalog', errors will be added to a 'Result' column in the status.df
        DataFrame (errors='catalog' must be combined with
        status=<Status object>).

    quiet : bool
        If True, suppresses progress output.

    status : spy.Status
        If supplied, this Status object will be updated as the command
        progresses.
