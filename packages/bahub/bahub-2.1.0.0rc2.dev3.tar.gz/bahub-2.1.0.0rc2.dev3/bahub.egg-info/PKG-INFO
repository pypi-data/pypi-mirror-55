        Project initially created for three purposes: 
        
        - To store static files uploaded for users (libertarian/anarchist portal)
        - To store and serve video files (video archive)
        - To store backups and version them. Limit the disk space and permissions to create a shared space for multiple organizations fighting for human-rights, tenants-rights, working-class rights and animals-rights.
