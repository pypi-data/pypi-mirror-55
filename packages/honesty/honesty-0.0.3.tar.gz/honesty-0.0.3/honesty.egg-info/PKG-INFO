Description: # Honesty
        
        There's a long tail of people doing interesting/sketchy things to packages on
        pypi.  Most aren't malicious, but this project gives you an easy way to check
        for some of the obvious ways that packages might be tampered with.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        honesty list <package name>
        honesty check <package name> [version|"*"] [--verbose]
        ```
        
        It will store a package cache by default under `~/.cache/honesty/pypi` but you
        can change that with `HONESTY_CACHE` env var.  If you have a local bandersnatch,
        specify `HONESTY_MIRROR_BASE` to your `/simple/` url.
        
        
        # Exit Status
        
        These are bit flags to make sense when there are multiple problems.  If you pass
        `*` for version, they are or'd together.
        
        ```
        0   if only sdist or everything matches
        1   if only bdist
        2   (reserved for future "extraction error")
        4   some .py from bdist not in sdist
        8   some .py files present with same name but different hash in sdist (common
            when using versioneer or 2to3)
        ```
