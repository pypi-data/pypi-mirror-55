        It can be configured to use an existing Python environment or to set up a temp environment
        for the experiment. The definition is also responsible for setting the required application
        dependencies.

    :param entry_script: User script which will be run in parallel on multiple nodes. This is
        specified as local file path. If source_directory is specified, then entry_script is
        a relative path inside. Otherwise, it can be any path accessible on machine.
    :type entry_script: str

        for FileDataset that should be ignored during processing. If the error count goes
        above this value, then the job will be aborted. Error threshold is for the entire
        input and not for individual mini-batches sent to run() method.
        The range is [-1, int.max]. -1 indicates ignore all failures during processing.
    :type error_threshold: int
    :param output_action: How the output to be organized. Currently supported values
        are 'append_row' and 'summary_only'.
        1. 'append_row' – All values output by run() method invocations will be aggregated into
        one unique file named parallel_run_step.txt that is created in the output location.
        2. 'summary_only' – User script is expected to store the output by itself. An output row
        is still expected for each successful input item processed. The system uses this output
        only for error threshold calculation (ignoring the actual value of the row).

        in one run() call. For TabularDataset input it is approximate size of data user script
        can process in one run() call. E.g. 1024, 1024KB, 10MB, 1GB.
