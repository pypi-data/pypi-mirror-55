        =====
        
        [pysap](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/pysap)
        is an open source Python library that provides modules for crafting and sending packets
        using SAP's NI, Diag, Enqueue, Router, Message Server, SNC, IGS and RFC
        protocols. In addition, support for creating and parsing different proprietary file
        formats is included. The modules are built on top of [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) and are
        based on information acquired at researching the different protocols, file formats
        and services.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Dissection and crafting of the following network protocols:
        
            * SAP Network Interface (NI)
            * SAP Diag
            * SAP Enqueue
            * SAP Router
            * SAP Message Server (MS)
            * SAP Secure Network Connection (SNC)
            * SAP Internet Graphic Server (IGS)
        
        * Client interfaces for handling the following file formats:
        
            * SAP SAR archive files
            * SAP PSE (Personal Security Environment) files
            * SAP SSO Credential (Credv2) files
        
        * Library implementing SAP's LZH and LZC compression algorithms.
        
        * Automatic compression/decompression of payloads with SAP's algorithms.
        
        * Client, proxy and server classes implemented for some of the protocols.
        
        * Example scripts to illustrate the use of the different modules and protocols.
