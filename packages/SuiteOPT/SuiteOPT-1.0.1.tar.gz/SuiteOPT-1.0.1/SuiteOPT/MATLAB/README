% ========================== SuiteOPT MATLAB README ============================
%  To compile a mex function for one or all of the solvers contained within
%  SuiteOPT, startup MATLAB in this directory, and then enter the following 
%  command in MATLAB:
%
%    >> make
%
%  After entering this command, respond to the prompt by MATLAB to install
%  the desired solver(s) for use with MATLAB.
%
%  NOTE: The installation of pproj and pasa require SuiteSparse (version  
%  5.4.0 or later). If the user does not have SuiteSparse, it should be 
%  downloaded and placed in the SuiteOPT directory (at the same level as the
%  directories CGDESCENT, MATLAB, NAPHEAP, PASA, PPROJ, SuiteOPTconfig, ...).
%  Alternatively, a symbolic link to the user's copy of SuiteSparse can be set 
%  in the SuiteOPT directory.
%
% ===================== Using SuiteOPT solvers with MATLAB =====================
%  To use one of the SuiteOPT solvers in MATLAB, navigate to the  
%  MATLAB subdirectory for that solver. Note that the upper level MATLAB
%  directory where the mex functions were compiled includes symbolic links
%  to each of the MATLAB subdirectories. Thus, commands of the form
%  "cd pasa" or "cd pproj" or "cd napheap" or "cd cg" take you to the MATLAB
%  subdirectory for the associated solver.  After navigating to one of
%  these subdirectories, information on how to set up and solve a problem
%  can be viewed by typing "demo". Additional help can be accesed 
%  in this directory by typing the solver name in the MATLAB command window.
%  The solver names are pasa, pproj, napheap, and cg_descent.
