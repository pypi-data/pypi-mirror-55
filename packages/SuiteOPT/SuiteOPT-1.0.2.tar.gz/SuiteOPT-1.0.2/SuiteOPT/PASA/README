If the constraint matrix has one row and the objective function is linear,
then the starting guess x is not used by the napheap algorithm. If the user
has a good starting guess, it can be used to compute a good multiplier
guess, which is used by napheap if pasaparm->use_lambda = TRUE. See
the napheap source file for a description of the multiplier.
