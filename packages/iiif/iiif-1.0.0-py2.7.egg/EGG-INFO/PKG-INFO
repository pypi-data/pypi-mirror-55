        *iiif* - A Python library providing a reference implementation
        of the `International Image Interoperability Framework
        <http://iiif.io/>`_: Image API
        `2.1
        <http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/>`_ (and versions
        `2.0
        <http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/>`_,
        `1.1
        <http://iiif.io/api/image/1.1/>`_, 
        `1.0
        <http://iiif.io/api/image/1.0/>`_).
        Also includes a test server using the library to implement the Image
        API transformations dynamically, and a static file generator to
        pre-compute tiles necessary for OpenSeadragon which may then be
        stored a static files.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The library, test server, static file generator are all designed to
        work with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Manual installation is 
        necessary to get the demonstration documentation and examples.
        
        **Automatic installation from PyPI**
        
        The *iiif* library code and scripts are listed in `PyPI
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iiif>`_ and can be installed with 
        ``pip`` or ``easy_install``, e.g.:: 
        
            easy_install iiif
        
        The PyPI version does not include all demonstration documentation and
        examples.
        
        **Manual installation from github**
        
        First, clone the code and examples from the `Github repository
        <https://github.com/zimeon/iiif>`_::
        
            cd /tmp
            git clone git://github.com/zimeon/iiif.git
            cd iiif/
        
        Second, install `Pillow` (a fork of `PIL`)::
        
            sudo pip install Pillow
        
        After installation of `Pillow` there will be be a summary of image formats
        supported. Addition libraries may be require to get all formats depending
        on your platform.
        
        The scripts and demonstrations can then be run from the `iiif` directory.
        
        Finally, you may install the library code and scripts locally in the 
        appropriate places within your python setup using::
        
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        The source code is maintained on `Github
        <https://github.com/zimeon/iiif>`_
