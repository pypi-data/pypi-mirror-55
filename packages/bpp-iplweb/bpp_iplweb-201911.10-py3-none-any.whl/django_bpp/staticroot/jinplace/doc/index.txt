==Introduction==

Jinplace is a jQuery plugin that is used to make sections of text on a
page editable directly from the page.  Editing starts by clicking on
the text. It then turns into an input field where the new text can be
typed.  Clicking outside the field will submit the new new text and
once a reply has been received, the input field is removed and the new
text replaces it.

That is the basic flow, but there are a number of options to change
this. So for example you can have explicit OK and cancel buttons and a separate
button to start editing.

== Basic usage ==

===Include the javascript files===
As this is a jQuery plugin, you must include a version of jQuery
first.  It will work with jQuery greater than or equal to version 1.7.
If you use version 2.0 or above, then you will of course lose IE6-8
compatibility.

Download the latest version of this plugin from
the [https://bitbucket.org/itinken/jinplace/downloads download directory].

=== Mark up the page ===

You should read this section in conjunction with
the [http://jinplace.org/demo.html demo]
which is structured like a mini tutorial for some of the
basic mark up attributes.

If text that you want to edit is already contained within an HTML
element then you can just add a class and the jinplace attributes to
it.  If not, or you just wish to keep things separate, then just
surround the text with a 'span' or 'div' element as appropriate.

<pre code=html>
Title: <span class="editable" data-url="/update_title.php">Hello world</span>
</pre>
