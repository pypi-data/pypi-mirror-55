= News =
== Version 1.0.1 ==
Minor release mainly to fix the documentation of the demo, since
it had to be moved.
An event is triggered when the replacement is done.

== Version 1.0.0 ==
This is identical to the 0.12.0 version, as no further
problems were found.

== Version 0.12.0 make select function behave as documented ==
Unfortunately select controls are not working as documented.
It expects the option value and converts it to the text value, instead
of expecting the text value directly, as is documented.

This release fixes the behaviour.

Since there isn't any way to make this backward compatible (although
it was always intended and documented to work that way) the -rc series
has been withdrawn and there will be a new 1.0.0 later.

== Version 0.11.0 submit function ==
<b>12 Aug 2013</b> Add user defined submit function so that you
have complete control over what happens when the edited data is
submitted.

Likewise there is also a user defined load function which is called
to fetch data for editing when there is a loadurl defined.

Fixed bug where the element id was not being submitted

== Version 0.10.1 improved api ==
'''22 July 2013''' If ok and/or cancel buttons are added, they have a css
class of jip-button and jip-ok-button or jip-cancel-button as
appropriate.

API fix for value() methods that return an integer or something other
than a string or plain object.

Bug fix by sourcecat (@github) for textOnly and placeholder options.
Tests added for them too.

== Version 0.10.0 improved api ==
'''20 July 2013''' The api is improved and a section added to the
documentation about writing a plugin. The API is now close to a
first complete version.

== data-nil changes to data-placeholder ==
'''10 July 2013''' The setting that used to be known as 'data-nil' is
now changed to 'data-placeholder'. The old name will still work for
a while, probably until the API is declared stable with 1.0.

Naturally the same is true of the config setting which is now
'placeholder'

<pre code=js>
$('.editable').jinplace({
	placeholder: '[Click!]'
});
</pre>
