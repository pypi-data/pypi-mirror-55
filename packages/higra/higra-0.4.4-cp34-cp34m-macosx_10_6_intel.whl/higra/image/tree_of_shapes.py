    """
    Tree of shapes of a 2d image.

    The Tree of Shapes was described in [1]_.
    The algorithm used in this implementation was first described in [2]_.

    The tree is computed in the interpolated multivalued Khalimsky space to provide a continuous and autodual representation of
    input image.

    Possible values of `padding` are `'none'`, `'mean'`, and `'zero'`.
    If `padding` is different from 'none', an extra border of pixels is added to the input image before
    anything else. This will ensure the existence of a shape encompassing all the shapes inside the input image
    (if exterior_vertex is inside the extra border): this shape will be the root of the tree.
    The padding value can be:

      - 0 if :attr:`padding` is equal to ``"zero"``;
      - the mean value of the boundary pixels of the input image if :attr:`padding` is equal to ``"mean"``.

    If :attr:`original_size` is ``True``, all the nodes corresponding to pixels not belonging to the input image
    are removed (except for the root node).
    If :attr:`original_size` is ``False``, the returned tree is the tree constructed in the interpolated/padded space.
    In practice if the size of the input image is :math:`(h, w)`, the leaves of the returned tree will correspond to an
    image of size:

      - :math:`(h, w)` if :attr:`original_size` is ``True``;
      - :math:`(h * 2 - 1, w * 2 - 1)` is :attr:`original_size` is ``False`` and padding is ``"none"``; and
      - :math:`((h + 2) * 2 - 1, (w + 2) * 2 - 1)` otherwise.

    :attr:`Exterior_vertex` defines the linear coordinates of the pixel corresponding to the exterior
    (interior and exterior of a shape is defined with respect to this point). The coordinate of this point must be
    given in the padded/interpolated space.
