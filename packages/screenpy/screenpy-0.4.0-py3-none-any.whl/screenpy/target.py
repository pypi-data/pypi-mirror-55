class Target:
    """
    A class to contain information about an element. This class stores a
    nice human-readable string describing an element along with either an
    XPath or a CSS selector string. It is intended to be instantiated by
    calling its static |Target.the| method. A typical invocation might
    look like:

        Target.the("header search bar").located_by("div.searchbar")

    It can then be used in Questions, Actions or Tasks to access that
    element.
