optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit

               How to handle files that exist only on one side?
                 MIRROR (default)
                   [source-only -> destination, delete destination-only]
                 BACKUP
                   [source-only -> destination, keep destination-only]
                 SYNC
                   [source-only -> destination, destination-only -> source]
  -c mode      Conflict resolution mode:
               How to handle files that exist on both sides but differ?
                 SOURCE (default)
                   [copy source to destination]
                 DEST
                   [copy destination to source]

  -d           Try and detect moved files
  --noarchive  Disable archiving, by default files are moved to
