        # Expipe
        
        Expipe is a lightweight data analysis platform that aims to simplify the steps
        from experiment to data analysis.
        We acknowledge the need for multiple tools, workflows and formats in
        experimental pipelines and have made an agnostic platform that focuses on adding
        value and formalizing existing workflows rather than a one-size-fits all
        solution.
        Expipe provides functionality to track experimental data and metadata for easy
        retrieval in exploration and analysis.
        The goal of Expipe is to simplify data management and allow the user to focus on
        production and analysis of the data.
