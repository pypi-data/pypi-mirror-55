# pyRinexpro
pyRinexpro is a Python client for the [rinexpro](https://rinexpro.com/en/home/) API.

## Install
pyRinexpro can be install using pip

```
pip install pyRinexpro
```
## Getting Started
The first step is to import the pyRinexpro module and to instantiate a pyRinexpro.Client using your API key

```python
>>> import pyRinexpro as rnx
>>> client = rnx.Client(API_KEY)
```
From the client you can create a pyRinexpro.Session by uploading a session file
```python
>>> session = client.uploadSession("your_session_file")
```
Once the session preprocessing is completed, which should take about 20 seconds, you can create and run a pyRinexpro.Process from this session
```python
>>> process = session.newProcess('ppp', mode='static')
```
Once the process is completed you can get the resultat as a pyRinexpro.Log object
```python
>>> log = process.getLog()
```
Trajectory can be transfom into a pandas.DataFrame object
```python
>>> log.trajectory.df()
```
Results can be exported to geojson, kml and kmz
```python
>>> log.to_geojson('new_file.json')
>>> log.to_kml('new_file.kml')
>>> log.to_kmz('new_file.kmz')
```
