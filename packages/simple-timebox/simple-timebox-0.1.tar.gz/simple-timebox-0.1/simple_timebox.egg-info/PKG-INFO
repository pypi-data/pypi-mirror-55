        Description
        -----------
        Timebox is a simple yet effective tool for staying efficient during a workday.
        
        Timeboxing is a time management technique that is believed to boost productivity by limiting the time during which a task is supposed to be completed. A time box is a fixed period of time alloted for a task or activity. The period of time to spend on the task is decided first (default 45 minutes). The duration of a time box may depend on the task or activity. Alternatively, the task may be scoped in a manner that it can be completed in a fixed size time box. Then a timer is started with the decided time interval. Once the timer notifies that the time interval has expired, any activity or work on the task is stopped, and a short break is taken before beginning another time box.
        
        Timebox is inspired by **[susam/timebox](https://github.com/susam/timebox)**
