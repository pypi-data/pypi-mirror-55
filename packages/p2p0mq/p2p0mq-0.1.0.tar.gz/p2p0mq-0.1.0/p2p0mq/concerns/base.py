    The concerns deal with messages on both side of the connection.

    Each concern has a command identification and, thus, can only handle
    exactly one command. The parameter is set in the constructor and
    should be kept constant after the instance has been made part of the
    application via start().

    Once the application hs been started the main loop will call execute()
    on the concern on each loop in the context of the app thread.
    The concern is free to add messages to application queue but
    it should not send them directly.

    The application builds maps for concerns so that, when a request or
    reply arrives the appropriate method will be called in the context
    of the sender/receiver thread.
