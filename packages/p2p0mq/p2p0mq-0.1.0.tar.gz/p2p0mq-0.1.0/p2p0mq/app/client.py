    A thread that sends requests and information
    to peers.

    These are "clients" according to the
    [zmq_curve](http://api.zeromq.org/4-1:zmq-curve) which states that:
    > A socket using CURVE can be either client or server,
    > at any moment, but not both.
    > The role is independent of bind/connect direction.

    To become a CURVE client, the application sets the ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY
    option with the long-term public key of the server it intends to
    connect to, or accept connections from, next. The application then
    sets the ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY and ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY
    options with its client long-term key pair.

    The sender provides three queues:
    - fast (sends all available messages every loop);
    - medium (sends oldest message of each peer every loop);
    - slow (sends oldest overall message;one message per loop).
