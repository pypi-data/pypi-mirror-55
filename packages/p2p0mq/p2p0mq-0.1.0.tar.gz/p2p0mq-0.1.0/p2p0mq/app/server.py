    """
    A thread that receives requests and information from peers.

    This is a "server" according to the
    [zmq_curve](http://api.zeromq.org/4-1:zmq-curve) which states that:
    > A socket using CURVE can be either client or server,
    > at any moment, but not both.
    > The role is independent of bind/connect direction.

    To become a CURVE server, the application sets the ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER
    option on the socket, and then sets the ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY option
    to provide the socket with its long-term secret key.
    The application does not provide the socket with its long-term public key,
    which is used only by clients.

    The receiver listens to messages and creates messages out of them.
    The messages are then placed in the queue where the application
    will pick them up.

    For now the receiver understands two kinds of messages: requests and
    replies. However,adding additional types is easy: add a queue to the
    typed_queues member and create code on application side to offload
    this queue.
