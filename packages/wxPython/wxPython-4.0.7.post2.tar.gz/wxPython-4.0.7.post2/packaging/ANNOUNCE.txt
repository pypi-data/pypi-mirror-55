Announcing wxPython 4.0.7
=========================

PyPI:   https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.7
Extras: https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/
Pip:    ``pip install wxPython==4.0.7``

This release is comprised mostly of fixes and minor features which have been
back-ported from the master branch. This release is likely the last release of
the 4.0.x release series, and is certainly the last 4.0.x release that will
support Python 2.7. It may still continue to build for Python 2.7 for some time, 
but no extra effort will be expended to keep it compatible.

Support for building for Python 3.8 has been added, as well as 3.8 binaries on
PyPI for Windows and MacOS.

This release provides the following changes:

* Bug fixes in wx.lib.calendar: key navigation across month boundaries is now 
  possible; key navigation now sets the date and fires the EVT_CALENDAR event; 
  setter APIs now set the date correctly (#1230).

* Switch to using a wx.Overlay in the Widget Inspection Tool to highlight
  widgets when running on a GTK3 port.

* Fixed issue in wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl where label editor could remain
  stuck forever (#1235).

* Fix a sometimes crash when using a wx.Overlay by letting the wx.DCOverlay hold
  a reference to the DC, to ensure that the DCOverlay is destroyed first.
  (PR#1301)
  
* Ported the embedding sample from Classic, which shows how to use wxPython from
  a C++ wxWidgets application that embeds Python. (PR #1353)

* Fixed wx.GetApp() to use wxWidgets' global wxApp instance instead of 
  maintaining its own pointer. This way, if the wxApp is created by C++ code
  wxPython will still be able to get access to it. (#1126)
  
* Several other PRs have been backported from the master branch (which will 
  become wxPython 4.1.0), the full list can be seen here:

What is wxPython?
-----------------

wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python programming
language.  It allows Python programmers to create programs with a
robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and
easily. It is implemented as a set of Python extension modules that
wrap the GUI components of the popular wxWidgets cross platform
library, which is written in C++. Supported platforms are Microsoft
Windows, Mac OS X and macOS, and Linux or other unix-like systems with
GTK2 or GTK3 libraries. In most cases the native widgets are used on
each platform to provide a 100% native look and feel for the
application.


What is wxPython Phoenix?
-------------------------

wxPython's Project Phoenix is a new from-the-ground-up implementation
of wxPython, created with the intent of making wxPython “better,
stronger, faster than he was before.” In other words, this new
implementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and
extensibility of wxPython, as well as removing most of the cruft that
had accumulated over the long life of Classic wxPython.

The project has been in development off and on, mostly behind the
scenes, for many years. For the past few years automated snapshot
builds have been available for those adventurous enough to try it, and
many people eventually started using the snapshots in their projects,
even for production releases.  While there are still some things on
the periphery that need to be completed, the core of the new wxPython
extension modules which wrap the wxWidgets code has been stable for a
long time now.

Due to some things being cleaned up, reorganized, simplified and
dehackified wxPython Phoenix is not completely backwards compatible
with wxPython Classic.  This is intended. In general, however, the API
differences tend to be minor and some applications can use Phoenix
with slight, or even with no modifications.  In some other cases the
correct way to do things was also available in Classic and it's only
the wrong way that has been removed from Phoenix.  For more
information there is a Migration Guide document available at:
https://docs.wxpython.org/MigrationGuide.html

The new wxPython API reference documentation, including all
Python-specific additions and customizations, and docs for the wx.lib
package, is located at: https://docs.wxpython.org/
