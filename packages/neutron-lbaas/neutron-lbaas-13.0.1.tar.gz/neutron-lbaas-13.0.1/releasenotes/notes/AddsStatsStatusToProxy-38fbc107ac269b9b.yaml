    The proxy plugin sends all LBaaS V2 API requests sent to Neutron to Octavia
    thus byapaasing the Neutron database. The proxy is specified instead of
    the 'lbaasv2' service plugin and called 'lbaasv2-proxy'. Since the proxy
    bypasses Neutron any existing LBaaS drivers will be bypassed as well.

    This finishes the proxy plugin piece which proxies all LBaaS requests to
    Octavia V2 API. Quotas are enforced on both and so operators are advised to
    set them on both ends accordingly.

    If any driver other than the Octavia driver is currently used in ths system
    operators need to perform the necessary migrations and/or wait until the
    respective driver is availble dor Octavia prior to activating this plugin.
