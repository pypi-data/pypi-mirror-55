features:
  - Adds the ability to automatically reschedule load
    balancers from LBaaS agents the server detects to have
    died. Previously, load balancers could be scheduled
    and realized across multiple LBaaS agents, however
    if a hypervisor died, the load balancers scheduled
    to that node would cease operation. Now, these load
    balancers will be automatically rescheduled to a
    different agent. This feature is turned off by
    default and controlled via
    allow_automatic_lbaas_agent_failover
