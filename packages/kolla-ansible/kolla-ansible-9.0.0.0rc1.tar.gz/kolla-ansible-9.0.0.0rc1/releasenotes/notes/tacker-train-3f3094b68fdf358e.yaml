    In Train, Tacker Conductor started using local filesystem to store VNF
    packages and CSAR files.
    Kolla Ansible provides no shared filesystem capabilities, hence only
    one instance of Tacker Conductor is deployed.
    Previous multinode deployments must manually remove all Tacker Conductors
    before proceeding with upgrade.
