We reverence Your spotless icon, O gracious Lord, and ask forgiveness of our transgressions, 
O Christ our God. Because of Your own good will You ascended the Cross in the flesh, 
that You might deliver those who You had created from the bondage of the enemy. 
We cry aloud unto You: You have filled all things with joy, O our Savior, 
for You came to save the world. 
Amen.
