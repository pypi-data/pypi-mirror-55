Description: # Wok
        
        Wok is a markup language, similar to Markdown but with a syntax based on [Pug](https://pugjs.org/). I'm aiming to make Wok into some kind of middle-ground between the power of HTML and the simplicity of Markdown. The idea came from wanting an open-source alternative to [Notion](https://notion.so/), an app I find to be quite powerful.
        
        Wok currently compiles only to HTML. A tool to compile-and-serve Wok files is available as a separate `wok-serve` package.
        
        Example usage:
        
        ```bash
        # Show help
        wok -h
        
        # Compile a few files
        wok my_wok_file.wok my_other_file.wok
        
        # Compile with glob
        wok *.wok
        ```
