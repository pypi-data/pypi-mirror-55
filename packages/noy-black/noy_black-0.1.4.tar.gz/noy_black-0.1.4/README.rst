NoseOfYeti aware black
======================

This is a monkey patch of black (https://github.com/psf/black) to give it the
ability to understand the noseOfYeti (http://noseofyeti.readthedocs.io)
``spec`` coding.

To use it::

   $ pip install noy_black
   $ noy_black file_to_format.py

Where all the arguments are the same as the normal black command.

It will even use noseOfYeti to tokenize the original and the formatted files to
check that the ast is equivalent before and after formatting with black.

Caveats
-------

Because ``it``, ``ignore``, ``context``, ``describe``, ``before_each`` and
``after_each`` are special keywords only for noseOfYeti, you can still use these
words as variable names. However you cannot start a line with any of these
keywords or black will get confused.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   # This will confuse black
   context = 1

   # This will not confuse black
   one, context = 1, 2

   # this will also not confuse black
   for it in [1, 2]:
      print(it)

   # but this will
   it = 1

Also, this works by defining the whole python grammar plus some extra grammar
so new versions of black will mean I have to update my version of the Grammar.
