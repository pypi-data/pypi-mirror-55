Sunburnt
========

This is a fork of Toby White's <toby@timetric.com> sunburnt, updated for Python 3.
This is mostly useful as a library that supports very old versions of Solr,
while supporting python 3.

Sunburnt is a Python-based interface for working with the `Apache Solr
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`_ search engine.

It's tested with Solr 3.5; previous versions were known to work
with 1.3, 1.4, 1.4.1 & 3.1.

It was originally written by Toby White <toby@timetric.com> for use in the `Timetric
platform <http://timetric.com>`_.
