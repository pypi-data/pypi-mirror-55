        Checklist and tools for increasing security of Apache Airflow.
         
        ## DISCLAIMER
        This project NOT AFFILIATED with the Apache Foundation and the Airflow project,
        and is not endorsed by them. 
        
        ## Contents
        The purpose of this project is provide tools to increase security of
        [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). 
        installations. This projects provides the following tools:
        - Configuration file with hardened settings - see [hardened_airflow.cfg](data/hardened_airflow.cfg).
        - Security checklist for hardening default installations - see [CHECKLIST.MD](data/CHECKLIST.md).
        - Static analysis tool to check Airflow configuration files for insecure settings.
        - JSON schema document used for validation by the static analysis tool - see [airflow_cfg.schema](data/airflow_cfg.schema)  
        
        # Information for the Static Analysis Tool (airflowscan)
        The static analysis tool can check an Airflow configuration file for settings related to security. The tool
        convers the config file to JSON, and then uses a JSON Schema to do the validation.
        
        ## Requirements
        Python 3 is required and you can find all required modules in the **requirements.txt** file.
        Only tested on Python 3.7 but should work on other 3.x releases. No plans to 2.x support at
        this time.
