Description: # noticeme
        
        Provides python bindings for inotify and framework for building file watchers using coroutines.
        
        Please note this only runs on Linux and a have no plans to support any other OS.
        
        There are many, many alternatives though.
        
        noticeme includes the noticeme command for quickly setting up a file watcher.
        
        ## Using noticeme declaratively
        
        If you just need a small file watcher you can try this out.
        
        ```
        pip install --user noticeme # install
        noticeme init # writes an initial config to .noticeme
        noticeme # start watching
        ```
        
        To see a full list of events:
        
        ```
          noticeme events
        ```
        
        To select which watchers we want to run we can give a list.\
        Say we had watchers named build:js, build:css, and test in a single config file.\
        In one terminal we could run:
        
        ```
          noticeme build:js build:css
        ```
        
        And in another:
        
        ```
          noticeme test
        ```
        
        ## Quick look at configuration
        
        see noticeme/examples/noticeme.cfg for details
        
        ```
        # noticeme.cfg
        [should]
          clear_screen = yes
        
        [imports]
          example = A .py file with a @noticeme.watcher decorator in it
        
        [my_watcher]
          description = This is an example.
          paths = . **
          events = written
          regex = ^docs
          glob = *.txt
          shell = echo "my_watcher: file was added"
        ```
        
        ## Using noticeme to build a file watcher programmatically
        
        ```
        import asyncio
        import noticeme
        
        @noticeme.watcher('/path/to/directory', 'created modified')
        async def my_watcher(event):
          if '.py' == event.path.suffix.lower():
            proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec('cmd', event.path.absolute())
            await proc.wait()
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
          noticeme.run()
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Linux >= 2.6.13
        - Python >= 3.5
        - cffi
        - C compiler installed (if you need to run inotify_build.py)
        
        ## Install
        
        ### pip
        
        ```
        pip install --user noticeme
        ```
        
        ### Include directly
        
        - Copy noticeme.py and inotify_build.py to your project directory
        - Within noticeme's package directory run:
        
        ```
        python3 inotify_build.py
        ```
        
        - This creates a 'build' directory containing the result of ffibuilder.compile
        - You should now be able to use noticeme.
        - inotify_build.py will no longer be needed.
