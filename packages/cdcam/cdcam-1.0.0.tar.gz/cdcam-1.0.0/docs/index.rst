Background and funding
----------------------

The **Cambridge Digital Communications Assessment Model** has been collaboratively developed
between the `Environmental Change Institute <http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/>`_ at the [University of
Oxford <https://www.ox.ac.uk/>`_, the [Networks and Operating Systems Group (NetOS)
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos>`_ at the `Cambridge Computer Laboratory
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk>`_,  and the UK's `Digital Catapult
<https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/>`_. Research activity between 2017-2018 also took place at
the `Cambridge Judge Business School <http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/home/>`_ at the `University of
Cambridge <http://www.cam.ac.uk/>`_.

Development has been funded by the EPSRC via (i) the `Infrastructure Transitions Research
Consortium <http://www.itrc.org.uk/>`_ (EP/N017064/1) and (ii) the UK's `Digital Catapult
