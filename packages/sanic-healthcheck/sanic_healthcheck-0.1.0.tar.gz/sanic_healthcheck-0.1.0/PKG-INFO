Description: # sanic-healthcheck
        
        ``sanic-healthcheck`` provides a simple way to add health checks and readiness checks to
        your [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic) application. This makes it easier to
        monitor your application and ensure it is running in a health state. Monitoring or management
        tools can ping these endpoints to determine application uptime and status, as well as perform
        application restart to ensure your application isn't running in a degraded state.
        
        ``sanic-healthcheck`` was inspired by and borrows from [Runscope/healthcheck](https://github.com/Runscope/healthcheck).

        ## Example
        
        Below is a trivial example showcasing basic usage of sanic-healthcheck
        
        ```python
        import random
        
        from sanic import Sanic, response
        from sanic_healthcheck import HealthCheck
        
        app = Sanic()
        health_check = HealthCheck(app)
        
        
        @app.route('/')
        async def test(request):
            return response.json({'hello', 'world'})
        
        
        # Define checks for the health check.
        def check_health_random():
            if random.random() > 0.9:
                return False, 'the random number is > 0.9'
            return True, 'the random number is <= 0.9'
        
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            health_check.add_check(check_health_random)
        
            app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
        ```
