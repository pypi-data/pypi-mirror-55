Description: # UnityPy
        A unity asset extractor based on [unitypack](https://github.com/HearthSim/UnityPack) and [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio).
        
        The basic structure is from AssetStudio and the object handling is from unitypack.
        
        ## Installation
        ```cmd
        pip install UnityPy
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        from UnityPy import AssetsManager
        
        am = AssetsManager()
        
        # Load file via file path
        am.load_file(fp)
        # Load all files in a folder
        am.load_folder(fp)
        
        for name, asset in am.assets.items():
            for id, obj in asset.objects.items():
                data = obj.read()
        ````
        
        ## Goals
        ### near future
        * adding a documentation
        
        ### far future
        * ability to edit assets (like in UABE)
        * broader object type support
        * code optimization
        * multiprocessing
        
        ## Motivation
        I'm an active data-miner and noticed that unitypack has problems with new unity assets.
        The problem in unitypack isn't that easy to fix and the undocumented code is a bit hard to understand.
        That's why I tried other tools like UABE and AssetStudio. Sadly none of these tools can be used like unitypack.
        That's why I started this project.
