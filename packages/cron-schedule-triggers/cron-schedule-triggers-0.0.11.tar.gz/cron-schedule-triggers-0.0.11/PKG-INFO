         Cron Schedule Triggers (CSTriggers) is a Python library enabling the ability to determine the next execution of a live schedule. Its syntax is that of [Quartz Job Scheduler](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org). This library is not a scheduling app or a task queue, there are plenty of those in the wild to choose from. When you need advanced customisation of triggers for tasks, and a common and conventional syntax for schedule notation, CSTriggers comes to your aid. 
         
        ## This library is for those who
        
         - Want the ability to generate future task data for visualization purposes.
         - Want to combine their own choice of solutions to build a customizable integrated task queuing/scheduling system at any scale.
         - Do not want to run java, but want to take advantage of the rich _Quartz Cron_ syntax
         - Do not want to drag in many dependencies into their project (Uses standard Python3 libraries only).
        
        
        ## Example usage
        
        Initialize a schedule object with a cron notation string, a start date, and an optional end date. Call `.next_trigger()` for a new date. Notice that when an end_date is given, The schedule terminates at `2022-10-13T00:00:00` and not `2030-03-01T00:00:00` as it would naturally.
        
        ```python
        from cstriggers.core.trigger import QuartzCron
        
        schedule_string = "0 0 0 1 JAN-MAR ? 2010-2030"
        start_date = "2019-10-13T00:00:00"
        end_date = "2022-10-13T00:00:00"
        cron_obj = QuartzCron(schedule_string=schedule_string, start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)
        
        print(cron_obj.next_trigger(isoformat=True))
        ```
        ```
        >> 2020-01-01T00:00:00
        ```
        
        For multiple sequential dates call either `.next_trigger()` multiple times.
        
        ```python
        from cstriggers.core.trigger import QuartzCron
        
        schedule_string = "0 0 0 1 JAN-MAR ? 2010-2030"
        start_date = "2019-10-13T00:00:00"
        end_date = "2022-10-13T00:00:00"
        cron_obj = QuartzCron(schedule_string=schedule_string, start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)
        
        print(cron_obj.next_trigger(isoformat=True))
        print(cron_obj.next_trigger(isoformat=True))
        
        ```
        
        ```
        >> 2020-01-01T00:00:00
        >> 2020-02-01T00:00:00
        ```
        
        Or call `.next_triggers()` with the number of triggers needed. 
        
        ```python
        from cstriggers.core.trigger import QuartzCron
        
        schedule_string = "0 0 0 1 JAN-MAR ? 2010-2030"
        start_date = "2019-10-13T00:00:00"
        end_date = "2022-10-13T00:00:00"
        cron_obj = QuartzCron(schedule_string=schedule_string, start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)
        
        print(cron_obj.next_triggers(number_of_triggers=10, isoformat=True))
        ```
        
        ```
        >> [
            '2020-01-01T00:00:00', 
            '2020-02-01T00:00:00', 
            '2020-03-01T00:00:00', 
            '2021-01-01T00:00:00', 
            '2021-02-01T00:00:00', 
            '2021-03-01T00:00:00', 
            '2022-01-01T00:00:00', 
            '2022-02-01T00:00:00', 
            '2022-03-01T00:00:00', 
            '2023-01-01T00:00:00'
        ]
        ```
        
        ## Roadmap
        - Support for last_trigger(s) to retroactively look at schedule dates.
        - Support for AWS Cron Expression syntax.
