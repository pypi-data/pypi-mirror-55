Description: ReMU - Response Matrix Utilities
        
        ReMU is a framework for response matrices in cross-section measurements and
        general counting experiments. It offers functions to build response matrices,
        and use them to compare truth-space expectation values with actual experimental
        results in reconstructed space.
        
        Systematic uncertainties about the detector response can be included in the
        matrices.  Done correctly, this enables anyone to test arbitrary models against
        data that was published together with a response matrix, including systematic
        detector effects. Intimate knowledge of the detector is only needed to build
        the response matrix, *not* to use it.
