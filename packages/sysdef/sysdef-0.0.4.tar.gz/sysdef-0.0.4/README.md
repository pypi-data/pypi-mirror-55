# sysdef

Sysdef takes a YAML file as input to either:
* Add configuration to an existing hard drive image
* Apply configuration on reboot

The aim is to produce easily customised SDCARD images which can then be booted
in IOT platforms like raspberry pi without the need for further manual
configuration.

On reboot, sysdef runs to ensure required services such as docker containers
and external hard drives are up and running

# Status: under development
This upload is to reserve the name on pypi. code is semi-working at this point
