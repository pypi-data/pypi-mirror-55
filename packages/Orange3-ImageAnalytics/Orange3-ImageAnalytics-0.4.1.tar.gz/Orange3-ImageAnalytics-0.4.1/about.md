Image Analytics
---------------

Simplifies loading of images and through deep network-based embedding 
enables their analysis. Embedding represents images with feature vector,
allowing the use of Orange's standard arsenal of widgets for 
clustering, classification or any other kind of 
feature-based analysis. Use Image Viewer from the core Orange 
to visualize the images.
