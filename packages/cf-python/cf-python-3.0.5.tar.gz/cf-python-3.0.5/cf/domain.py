class Domain(cfdm.Domain):
    '''A domain of the CF data model.

The domain represents a set of discrete "locations" in what generally
would be a multi-dimensional space, either in the real world or in a
model's simulated world. These locations correspond to individual data
array elements of a field construct

The domain is defined collectively by the following constructs of the
CF data model: domain axis, dimension coordinate, auxiliary
coordinate, cell measure, coordinate reference and domain ancillary
constructs.
