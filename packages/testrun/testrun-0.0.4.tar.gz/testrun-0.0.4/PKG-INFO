        This testing module is intended for small-scale testing of python, including
            in IDLE. Notable features include:
        
        `TestRun`: 
          A base class for a test-suite, including automatic test-detection 
          (for methods beginning with 'test_'), running all available tests or a 
          specified set with 'run_tests', running the tests which failed in the last 
          run with 'run_failed_tests', and automatic (not in IDLE) and user-generated 
          timeouts while testing.
        
        `TestGroup`: 
          A class for grouping multiple TestRun instances as though they are a single 
          instance.
        
        `Redirect`: 
          A class for stream redirection and multiplication, focused on stdin, stdout, 
          and stderr, but also usable for general file streams. Allows for capturing 
          printed output and simulating typed input while testing.
        
        `MultiRedirect`: 
          A class for managing multiple redirections, allowing for methods to be run 
          simultaneously on all stored redirections.
