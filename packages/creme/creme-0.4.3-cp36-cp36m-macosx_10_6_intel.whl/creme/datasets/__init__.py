    This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market. In this market,
    prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every
    five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to
    alleviate fluctuations.

    The dataset (originally named ELEC2) contains 45,312 instances dated from 7 May 1996 to 5
    December 1998. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of 30 minutes, i.e. there are 48
    instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has 5 fields, the day of
    week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand,
    the scheduled electricity transfer between states and the class label. The class label
    identifies the change of the price (UP or DOWN) in New South Wales relative to a moving average
    of the last 24 hours (and removes the impact of longer term price trends).

    Parameters:
        data_home (str): The directory where you wish to store the data.
        silent (bool): Whether to indicate download progress or not.

    Yields:

    (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

    It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
    Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more
    background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components
    obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and
    'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first
    transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be
    used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and
    it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

    Parameters:
        data_home (str): The directory where you wish to store the data.
        silent (bool): Whether to indicate download progress or not.

    Yields:
