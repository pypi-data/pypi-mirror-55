        :type AccountId: string
        :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]**

          The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budget.

        :type Budget: dict
        :param Budget: **[REQUIRED]**

          The budget object that you want to create.

          - **BudgetName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and ``\`` characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

          - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

            The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

             ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

            - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

            - **Unit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

          - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

            A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

            For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

            For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

            If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining periods.

            If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values from the start date of the budget.

            After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

             ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

            - *(string) --*

            The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. ``DAILY`` is available only for ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

          - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

            The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an end date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come before ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

            If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

            You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.

            - **Start** *(datetime) --*

              The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            - **End** *(datetime) --*

              The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

        :type Notification: dict
        :param Notification: **[REQUIRED]**

          The notification that you want to create.

          - **NotificationType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (``ACTUAL`` ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (``FORECASTED`` ).

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The comparison that is used for this notification.

          - **Threshold** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage.

            The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          - **NotificationState** *(string) --*

            Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you have passed the set threshold for the budget.

          - *(dict) --*

            The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists of a subscription type and either an Amazon SNS topic or an email address.

            For example, an email subscriber would have the following parameters:

            * A ``subscriptionType`` of ``EMAIL``

            * An ``address`` of ``example@example.com``

            - **SubscriptionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The type of notification that AWS sends to a subscriber.

            - **Address** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The description of the budget.

              - **BudgetName** *(string) --*

                The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and ``\`` characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

              - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

                The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

                 ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

                - **Amount** *(string) --*

                  The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                - **Unit** *(string) --*

                  The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

              - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

                A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

                 ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

                For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining periods.

                If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values from the start date of the budget.

                After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

                 ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

                    - **Start** *(datetime) --*

                      The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                      You can change your start date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

                    - **End** *(datetime) --*

                      The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                      After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

          **Response Structure**

          - *(dict) --*

            Response of DescribeBudgets

            - **Budgets** *(list) --*

              A list of budgets.

              - *(dict) --*

                Represents the output of the ``CreateBudget`` operation. The content consists of the detailed metadata and data file information, and the current status of the ``budget`` object.

                This is the ARN pattern for a budget:

                 ``arn:aws:budgetservice::AccountId:budget/budgetName``

                - **BudgetName** *(string) --*

                  The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account. The ``:`` and ``\`` characters aren't allowed in ``BudgetName`` .

                - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

                  The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

                   ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

                  - **Amount** *(string) --*

                    The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                  - **Unit** *(string) --*

                    The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

                - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

                  A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

                   ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

                  For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                  For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

                  If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining periods.

                  If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values from the start date of the budget.

                  After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

                   ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

                  - *(string) --*

                    A generic string.

                    - *(dict) --*

                      The amount of cost or usage that is measured for a budget.

                      For example, a ``Spend`` for ``3 GB`` of S3 usage would have the following parameters:

                      * An ``Amount`` of ``3``

                      * A ``unit`` of ``GB``

                      - **Amount** *(string) --*

                        The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                      - **Unit** *(string) --*

                        The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

                - **CostFilters** *(dict) --*

                  * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute

                  * Amazon Redshift

                  * Amazon Relational Database Service

            Response of GetNotificationsForBudget

            - **Notifications** *(list) --*

              A list of notifications that are associated with a budget.

              - *(dict) --*

                A notification that is associated with a budget. A budget can have up to five notifications.

                Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

                For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

                * A notificationType of ``ACTUAL``

                * A ``thresholdType`` of ``PERCENTAGE``

                * A ``comparisonOperator`` of ``GREATER_THAN``

                * A notification ``threshold`` of ``80``

                - **NotificationType** *(string) --*

                  Whether the notification is for how much you have spent (``ACTUAL`` ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (``FORECASTED`` ).

                - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --*

                  The comparison that is used for this notification.

                - **Threshold** *(float) --*

                  The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage.

                - **ThresholdType** *(string) --*

                  The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

                - **NotificationState** *(string) --*

                  Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you have passed the set threshold for the budget.

            - **NextToken** *(string) --*

              The pagination token in the service response that indicates the next set of results that you can retrieve.

          - **BudgetLimit** *(dict) --*

            The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you want to track with your budget.

             ``BudgetLimit`` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to ``100`` , which is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You can't use ``BudgetLimit`` with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` for ``CreateBudget`` and ``UpdateBudget`` actions.

            - **Amount** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

            - **Unit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

              The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

          - **PlannedBudgetLimits** *(dict) --*

            A map containing multiple ``BudgetLimit`` , including current or future limits.

             ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` is available for cost or usage budget and supports monthly and quarterly ``TimeUnit`` .

            For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The ``key`` is the start of the month, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

            For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The ``key`` is the start of the quarter, ``UTC`` in epoch seconds.

            If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values only for the remaining periods.

            If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` values from the start date of the budget.

            After all of the ``BudgetLimit`` values in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the ``BudgetLimit`` . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.

             ``DescribeBudget`` and ``DescribeBudgets`` response along with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will also contain ``BudgetLimit`` representing the current month or quarter limit present in ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . This only applies to budgets created with ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` . Budgets created without ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` will only contain ``BudgetLimit`` , and no ``PlannedBudgetLimits`` .

            The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. ``DAILY`` is available only for ``RI_UTILIZATION`` , ``RI_COVERAGE`` , ``Savings_Plans_Utilization`` , and ``Savings_Plans_Coverage`` budgets.

          - **TimePeriod** *(dict) --*

            The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an end date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come before ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` .

            If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose ``DAILY`` , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to ``01/24/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you chose ``MONTHLY`` , AWS set your start date to ``01/01/18 00:00 UTC`` . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

            You can change either date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.

            After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.

            - **Start** *(datetime) --*

              The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY).

            - **End** *(datetime) --*

              The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to ``06/15/87 00:00 UTC`` . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers. You can change your end date with the ``UpdateBudget`` operation.
