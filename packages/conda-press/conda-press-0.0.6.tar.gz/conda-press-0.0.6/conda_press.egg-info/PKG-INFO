Description: # conda-press
        
        Press conda packages into wheels.
        
        The wheels created by conda-press are usable in a general Python
        setting, i.e. outside of a conda managed environment.
        
        ## Quick start
        
        Run the `conda press` command and point it at either an artifact
        file or spec. For example:
        
        ```
        # from artifact spec, produces single wheel, including all non-Python requirements
        $ conda press --subdir linux-64 --skip-python --fatten scikit-image=0.15.0=py37hb3f55d8_2
        
        # from artifact file, produces a single wheel
        $ conda press numpy-1.14.6-py36he5ce36f_1201.tar.bz2
        
        # from artifact spec, produces wheels for package and all requirements
        $ conda press --subdir linux-64 xz=5.2.4=h14c3975_1001
        
        # merge many wheels into a single wheel
        $ conda press --merge *.whl --output scikit_image-0.15.0-2_py37hb3f55d8-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```
        
        ## What we are solving
        
        conda-press allows us to build out a pip-usable package index which is
        ABI compatible with conda packages. This can help address the following
        issues / workflows:
        
        **Issue 1:**
        
        It can be very difficult to build wheels for packages that have C extensions.
        Also, the provenance of wheels with C extentions can be hard to know (who built it,
        how it was built, etc.). Conda-press enables community building of wheels,
        based on conda-forge provided packages. This should make it very easy to build a
        valid wheel.
        
        **Issue 2:**
        
        Many packages with compiled extensions do not have wheels available on one or more
        popular platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). This is because building wheels can
        be very difficult.  Conda has a lot of packages that are not available as wheels otherwise.
        Conda-press allows these packages to easily become generally usable wheels.
        
        **Issue 3:** Some people want a package index built on newer ABIs than `manylinux<N>`
        
        
        ## How to install
        
        From conda:
        
        ```
        conda install -c conda-forge conda-press
        ```
        
        From the source code:
        
        ```
        $ pip install --no-deps .
        ```
        
        ## More technical details about what we are doing
        
        What conda-press does is take an artifact or spec, and turn it into wheel(s).
        When using pip to install such a wheel, it shoves the root level of the artifact
        into site-packages. It then provides wrapper / proxy scripts that point to
        site-packages/bin so that you may run executables and scripts.
