        **************
        
        This package defines three "lifecycle" events that notify about object
        creation, modification and deletion. The events include information about the
        user responsible for the changes.
        
        The modification event also includes information about the state of the object
        before the changes.
        
        The module also contains Snapshot support to save the state of an object for
        notification, and to compute deltas between version of objects.
