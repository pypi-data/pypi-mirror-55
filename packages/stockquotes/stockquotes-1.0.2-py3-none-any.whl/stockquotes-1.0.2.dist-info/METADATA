# Project Description
`stockquotes` is a simple Python module for collecting stock quotes and historical data from Yahoo! Finance. It's perfect for developers who can't afford the (often steep) prices charged by many stock data APIs.
# Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Beautiful Soup 4
# Installation
    pip3 install stockquotes
# Usage
First, import the `stockquotes` module.

    import stockquotes

To get a stock quote, instantiate a `stockquotes.Stock` object. The only parameter is the ticker symbol to look up.

    kroger = stockquotes.Stock('KR')

## Basic data
To get the current price of a share, get the `Stock`'s `currentPrice`.

    krogerPrice = kroger.currentPrice

To get the day gain in dollars, get the `Stock`'s `increaseDollars`.

    krogerGainDollars = kroger.increaseDollars

The same value as a percent is available in the `increasePercent` property. To indicate losses, these values are negative.

## Historical data
The historical data for a stock can be accessed through the `Stock`'s `historical` property. This is an array of `dict`s, with the first item representing the most recent quote. The `dict`'s `date` property is a `datetime` object representing the date the quote is from. `open` is the opening price for that day. `high` and `low` are the high and low prices, respectively, for that day. `close` and `adjClose` are the closing price. The difference is that `adjClose` is adjusted for splits and dividends, whereas `close` is adjusted only for splits. `volume` is the stock's volume for that day.
# Exceptions
`stockquotes.StockDoesNotExistError` is raised when the stock does not exist.
`stockquotes.NetworkError` is raised when a connection to Yahoo! Finance cannot be established.
