Description: Templaty
        ========
        
        **Templaty** is a code generator written in Python that focuses on generating
        code for programming languages other than HTML. It features fine-grained
        control over whitespacing and indentation and a rich meta-language that allows 
        full control over the code to be generated.
        
        The template syntax was inspired by [Jinja2][1] and should be very easy to pick
        up.
        
        ```
        def sum_all_foos():
          {% for i in range(0, 10) %}
            foo{{i+1}} = 1
          {% endfor %}
          return {% join i in range(0, 10) with ' + ' %}foo{{i+1}}{% endjoin %}
        ```
        
        Generates the following code:
        
        ```
        def sum_all_foos():
          foo1 = 1
          foo2 = 1
          foo3 = 1
          foo4 = 1
          foo5 = 1
          foo6 = 1
          foo7 = 1
          foo8 = 1
          foo9 = 1
          foo10 = 1
          return foo1 + foo2 + foo3 + foo4 + foo5 + foo6 + foo7 + foo8 + foo9 + foo10
        ```

        ## Usage
        
        Eventually, Templaty will be available on PyPi and you'll be able to issue the following command:
        
        ```
        pip3 install -U --user templaty
        ```
        
        This should make the main command `templaty` available in your terminal.
        
        ## FAQ
        
        ### Will this library support Python 2?
        
        No. Python 2 has reached its end-of-life and the organisation recommends
        everyone to upgrade to Python 3. Porting to Python 2 requires extra work
        for no good reason.
        
        ### Is it safe to use this library in my web server?
        
        No, absolutely not! Templaty is a tool meant to be run by developers, not
        end-users. As such, it has little (if any) security checks. You should never
        run untrusted input using Templaty, only code you wrote yourself or from a
        developer you trust.
        
        ## License
        
        Templaty is licensed under the MIT license, in the hope it will help developers
        write better programs.
