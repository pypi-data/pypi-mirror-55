## Introduction
'TextAnalyticsLab'/'TextLab' is a Python package providing a set of text analytics tools 
for data mining and machine learning projects and end-to-end text analytics 
application development. It is compatible with and interoperate with data 
analysis and manipulation library Pandas,  natural language processing library 
nltk, Machine Lerning TookKit (pymltoolkit|mltk), and many other AI and machine 
learning platforms. 

## Installation
```
pip install TextLab
```
If the installation failed with dependancy issues, execute the above command with --no-dependencies

```
pip install TextLab --no-dependencies
```

## Functions
- Text Similarity
- OCR (A wrapper to convert image documents to text using Tesseract-OCR and Ghostscript)
- Text Mining and Information Extraction (in v0.2.0)
- Cleaning Text content (in v0.1.5)
- Web Scraping (in v0.1.5)
- Classification of Text Conent (in v0.2.0)


## Usage
```python
import textlab
```

### Warning: Python Variable, Function or Class names 
The Python interpreter has a number of built-in functions. It is possible to overwrite thier definitions when coding without any rasing a warning from the Python interpriter. (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
Therfore, AVOID THESE NAMES as your variable, function or class names.
<table border="1">
<tr><td>abs</td><td>all</td><td>any</td><td>ascii</td><td>bin</td><td>bool</td><td>bytearray</td><td>bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>callable</td><td>chr</td><td>classmethod</td><td>compile</td><td>complex</td><td>delattr</td><td>dict</td><td>dir</td></tr>
<tr><td>divmod</td><td>enumerate</td><td>eval</td><td>exec</td><td>filter</td><td>float</td><td>format</td><td>frozenset</td></tr>
<tr><td>getattr</td><td>globals</td><td>hasattr</td><td>hash</td><td>help</td><td>hex</td><td>id</td><td>input</td></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>isinstance</td><td>issubclass</td><td>iter</td><td>len</td><td>list</td><td>locals</td><td>map</td></tr>
<tr><td>max</td><td>memoryview</td><td>min</td><td>next</td><td>object</td><td>oct</td><td>open</td><td>ord</td></tr>
<tr><td>pow</td><td>print</td><td>property</td><td>range</td><td>repr</td><td>reversed</td><td>round</td><td>set</td></tr>
<tr><td>setattr</td><td>slice</td><td>sorted</td><td>staticmethod</td><td>str</td><td>sum</td><td>super</td><td>tuple</td></tr>
<tr><td>type</td><td>vars</td><td>zip</td><td>__import__</td></tr>
</table>

If you accedently overwrite any of the built-in function (e.g. list), execute the following to bring built-in defition.
```python
del(list)
```

## Text Analytics Example

### Text Similarity
```python
import textlab

str1 = 'Hello'
str2 = 'Hola'

dl_distance = textlab.damerau_levenshtein_distance(str1, str2, case_sensitive=True, normalized=False)
print('damerau_levenshtein_distance: ', dl_distance)

dl_distance_normalized = textlab.damerau_levenshtein_distance(str1, str2, case_sensitive=True, normalized=True)
print('damerau_levenshtein_distance (normalized): ', dl_distance_normalized)

substrings = textlab.get_substrings(string=str1, case_sensitive=True, min_length=2, max_length=512)
print('substrings: ', substrings)

j_index = textlab.jaccard_index(str1, str2, method='substring', case_sensitive=True, min_length=1, max_length=512) #method='words'
print('jaccard_index: ', round(j_index,3))
```

```
damerau_levenshtein_distance:  3
damerau_levenshtein_distance (normalized):  0.6
substrings:  ['He', 'll', 'Hel', 'el', 'llo', 'lo', 'ello', 'Hell', 'Hello', 'ell']
jaccard_index:  0.143
```

#Text from Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address
text = """
An email address identifies an email box to which email messages are delivered. A wide variety of formats were used in early email systems, but only a single format is used today, following the standards developed for Internet mail systems since the 1980s. This article uses the term email address to refer to the addr-spec defined in RFC 5322, not to the address that is commonly used; the difference is that an address may contain a display name, a comment, or both.

Valid email addresses
simple@example.com
very.common@example.com
disposable.style.email.with+symbol@example.com
other.email-with-hyphen@example.com
fully-qualified-domain@example.com
user.name+tag+sorting@example.com (may go to user.name@example.com inbox depending on mail server)
x@example.com (one-letter local-part)
example-indeed@strange-example.com
admin@mailserver1 (local domain name with no TLD, although ICANN highly discourages dotless email addresses)
example@s.example (see the List of Internet top-level domains)
" "@example.org (space between the quotes)
"john..doe"@example.org (quoted double dot)
Invalid email addresses
Abc.example.com (no @ character)
A@b@c@example.com (only one @ is allowed outside quotation marks)
a"b(c)d,e:f;g<h>i[j\k]l@example.com (none of the special characters in this local-part are allowed outside quotation marks)
just"not"right@example.com (quoted strings must be dot separated or the only element making up the local-part)
this is"not\allowed@example.com (spaces, quotes, and backslashes may only exist when within quoted strings and preceded by a backslash)
this\ still\"not\\allowed@example.com (even if escaped (preceded by a backslash), spaces, quotes, and backslashes must still be contained by quotes)
"""

email_addresses = textlab.extract_email_addresses(text)
```

Output:
```
['simple@example.com',

```

## Processing Documents
```python
test_image_file = 'test.jpg'
test_pdf_file = 'test.pdf'
```

```python
# Set Tesseract environment variables
textlab.set_tesseract_path(tesseract_path=r'C:\Projects\Tesseract', temp_folder=None)

# Set Ghostscript environment variables
textlab.set_ghostscript_path(ghostscript_path=r'C:\Projects\GhostScript\bin', temp_folder=r'C:\Projects\GhostScript\temp', ghostscript_exe='gswin64c.exe')

```python
# Trimming Image Borders
image = textlab.read_image_file(file_path=test_image_file, show_image=False)
boundbox = textlab.get_active_image_area(image, background='white')
image = textlab.draw_image_box(image, boundbox=[(0, 0), image.size], color=(0,0,255), width=5)
image = textlab.draw_image_box(image, boundbox=boundbox, color=(255,0,0), width=5)
image.show()
```

### OCR Test
```python

image = textlab.read_image_file(file_path=test_image_file, show_image=False)

output = textlab.image_to_osd(image, lang='eng', oem='0', dpi='90', tessdata_dir=None, os_temp=False)
print(output)

output = textlab.image_to_text(image, osd=True, aps=True, lang='eng', dpi='90', tessdata_dir=None, os_temp=False)
print(output['text'])

output = textlab.image_to_text_map(image, lang='eng', oem='0', dpi='90', tessdata_dir=None, os_temp=False)
print(output)

output = textlab.image_to_html(image, osd=True, aps=True, oem='3', lang='eng', dpi='90')
print(output['html'])

output = textlab.image_to_searchable_pdf(image, osd=False, aps=False, sparse=True, oem='0', lang='eng', dpi='90')
print(output['pdf'])
```

### PDF To Image
```python
images = textlab.pdf_to_images(pdf_file=test_pdf_file, image_format='png', dpi=300, out_file_prefix='out_', start_page=1, end_page=None, temp_folder=None)
```

### Process PDF file and store results in Pandas DataFrame
```python
set_ghostscript_path(ghostscript_path=r'C:\Projects\GhostScript\bin', temp_folder=r'C:\Projects\GhostScript\temp', ghostscript_exe='gswin64c.exe')
set_tesseract_path(tesseract_path=r'C:\Projects\Tesseract', temp_folder=r'C:\Projects\Tesseract\temp')
ImagesTable = create_document_image_table(r'C:\Projects\test\test.pdf', start_page=1, end_page=None)
ImagesTable = process_docuement_image_table(ImagesTable)
```

Convert PDF or Image file to text
```python
ImagesTextTable = convert_document_file_to_text(file_path, osd=True, aps=True, lang='eng', dpi=90, oem='3')
```
Convert PDF to Image DataFrame
```python
ImagesTable = create_document_image_table(file_path, start_page=1, end_page=None)
```

Appy OCR on Images DataFrame 
```python
ImagesTextTable = convert_document_image_table_to_text(ImagesTable, osd=True, aps=True, lang='eng', oem='3', dpi=90, tessdata_dir=None, os_temp=False)
```
