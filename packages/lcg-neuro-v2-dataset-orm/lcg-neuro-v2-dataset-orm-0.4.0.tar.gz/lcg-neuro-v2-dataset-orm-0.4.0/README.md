This repository contains a [Python package][latest release] based on the [SQLAlchemy] object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for accessing the V2 Dataset's curated information.
It also contains a minimal [command-line interface](https://lcg.gitlab.io/neuro/v2/dataset/python-orm/cli.html) that supports the creation of [SQLite] databases to hold curated information and its manipulation through a set of [parsing routines](https://lcg.gitlab.io/neuro/v2/dataset/python-orm/api/v2_dataset.db.parsing.html) that are being continuously developed.

The curated information itself is stored in the [contents repository], together with information on how to obtain the recording data (which is not open-sourced, as of now).
The [contents repository] should be cloned *separately* and linked from your working copy, as explained below.

## Installation and setup

The library may be installed with

   ```bash
   pip install lcg-neuro-v2-dataset-orm
   ```

Additional steps:
   
1. Clone the V2 Dataset's [contents repository] to any directory on your computer, *e.g.*:

   ```bash
   git clone git@gitlab.com:lcg/neuro/v2/dataset/contents /data/v2-dataset
   ```
   
   **Make sure** to check out a **compatible version** of the [contents repository].
   Usually, the latest version of the library will be compatible with the latest version of the dataset.

1. The library must be able to locate the dataset directory, which can be done in one of two ways:

   * If Define a `V2_DATASET_DIR` environment variable pointing to the directory where you cloned the [contents repository] (you may do it with a `.envrc` file), or
   * Create a symlink named `dataset` (it is Git-ignored in this repository) in your working copy or library installation directory (`/lib/pythonx.y/site-packages/lcg-neuro-v2-dataset-orm`) pointing to the [contents repository] copy.

**Note:** You may need `g++` or `clang` to compile some dependent libraries's extensions.

## Development notes

### Git LFS and cloning

Cloning may take a while because we use [Git LFS] to track larger files that are included mainly for testing.
After the initial cloning, further pushing/pulling/fetching should only take as long as needed to download missing files, which we intend to keep at a minimum over this project's lifetime.

**Important:** you must install [Git LFS] before cloning.
