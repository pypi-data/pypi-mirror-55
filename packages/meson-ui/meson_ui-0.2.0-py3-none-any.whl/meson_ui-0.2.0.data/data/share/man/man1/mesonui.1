.SH NAME
meson-ui - CLI GUI plug-in for Meson a high productivity build system
.SH DESCRIPTION

Meson-ui is a Graphical application designed to provide an interactive
way to use the Meson build system. We believe it is a nice way to get
CMake users comfortable with Meson.

The app was written in Python so that it can be OS agnostic and easy
to download.  The definition of easy to download can be explained with
the design of Meson-ui, witch was to be a command line plugin for Meson
meaning if you have Meson then by entering “meson” followed the Meson
arguments you would get totally normal Meson behavior but if you enter
“meson-ui” then the GUI would open to provide that needed graphical
experience to the users.

.SH The run app command

Using Meson-ui is simple, all you need to do is run
this command:

.B meson-ui

.SH The run app as curses command

.B meson-ui
