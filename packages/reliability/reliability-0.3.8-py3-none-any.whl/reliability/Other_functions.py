Other Functions

This is a collection of several other functions and statistical tests that did not otherwise fit within their own module.
Included functions are:
one_sample_proportion - Calculates the upper and lower bounds of reliability for a given number of trials and successes.
two_proportion_test - Calculates whether the difference in test results between two samples is statistically significant.
sample_size_no_failures - used to determine the sample size required for a test in which no failures are expected, and the desired
    outcome is the lower bound on the reliability based on the sample size and desired confidence interval.
sequential_sampling_chart - plots the accept/reject boundaries for a given set of quality and risk levels. If supplied, the test results
    are also plotted on the chart.
convert_dataframe_to_grouped_lists - groups values in a 2-column dataframe based on the values in the left column and returns those groups in a list of lists

    CI - confidence interval of result (between 0.5 and 1). Defaults to 0.95 for 95% CI.
    lifetimes - if testing the product for multiple lifetimes then more failures are expected so a smaller sample
        size will be required to demonstrate the desired reliability (assuming no failures). Conversely, if testing for
        less than one full lifetime then a larger sample size will be required. Default is 1.
