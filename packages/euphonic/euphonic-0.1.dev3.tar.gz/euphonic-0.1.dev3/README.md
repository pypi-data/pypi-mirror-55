# Euphonic
Euphonic is a Python package that can calculate phonon bandstructures and
inelastic neutron scattering intensities from modelling code outputs (e.g.
CASTEP). In addition, it can also do simple plotting, and can also plot
dispersion and density of states from existing CASTEP .bands or .phonon files.
