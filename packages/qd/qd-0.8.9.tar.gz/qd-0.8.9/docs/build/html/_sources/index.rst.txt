Welcome to qd's documentation!
==============================

qd is python3 library for Computer Aided Engineering (CAE). I've developed this library, since I was very unhappy with many expensive commercial software tools in our field of work. I believe many new scientific ideas emerge from freedom and simplicity, therefore the main focus of this project was on a good API and Speed. As a result memory took quite some, so watch you RAM when you load a full vehicle.

.. warning::
    This library is maintained for bugfixes only. Migrate to `lasso-python`_ if possible. Note please, that not all features are available in `lasso-python`_.

Installation
============

Installation can be done by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install qd

Windows uses precompiled wheels, which includes femzip decompression. Femzip decompression requires the intel libraries ``libmmd.dll`` and ``libiomp5.dll`` to be in your system path. For Anaconda Python you can easily install them through:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install icc_rt mkl

If the installation fails please check the compilation guide below. Compilation is required especially on Linux.

Compilation Guide
=================

Try installation of the precompiled python wheels in the `dist folder`_ before compiling it yourself. If your python distribution doesn't match any of the wheels, then you're in the right spot here.
