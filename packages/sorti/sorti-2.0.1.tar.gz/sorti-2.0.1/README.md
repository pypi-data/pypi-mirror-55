# sorti

An opinionated CLI for [asottile/reorder_python_imports].

## Installation

```bash
pip install sorti
```

## Usage

```bash
sorti [-h] [--check] [--version] [source [source ...]]
```

### Examples

Sorting imports in a single file

```bash
sorti my/file.py
```

Checking if any files in a directory need sorting

```bash
sorti --check my/directory
```

## Why?

This package makes the features of reorder_python_imports fit into my workflow.
I think the original project is awesome, but the CLI does not work the way I
would like it to.

My opinions diverge from asottile's on these issues.

- https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports/issues/45
- https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports/issues/74
- https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports/pull/76

So, `sorti` will support a much narrower use case than the original project.
The command has one flag: `--check`, which will make the command output the
files it would change and return an exit code of 1 if there are changes to be
made.

`sorti` uses source file discovery from [python/black] and aims to find the
same files, given the same inputs.

I don't intend to support anything else than latest stable Python, for the
moment that is 3.7.

The name sorti which means exit in Swedish seemed fitting since the divergence
of opinions that lead to its creation was about exit codes, it's also a play on
the popular import sorter isort. In Old Norse it means black cloud, which also
seems appropriate since it uses parts of black.
