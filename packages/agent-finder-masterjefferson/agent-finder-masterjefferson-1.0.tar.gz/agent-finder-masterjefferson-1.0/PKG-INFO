Description: # agent-finder
        Find nearby auto insurance agents using the Google Maps Places API, and dump them to a CSV file.
        
        This script was written to help automate part of
        my girlfriends job. Maybe someone else will find it useful too.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```shell script
        pip3 install agent-finder-masterjefferson
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        #### Google Maps API
        You must have a valid Google Maps API key.
        
        In your shell configuration file (.zshrc, .bash_profile, .bashrc, etc):
        ```shell script
        export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
        ```
        
        #### Basic search:
        
        ```shell script
        agent-finder "Los Angeles, CA"
        ```
        
        You can also customize the CSV filename and the search radius (units = kilometers).
        ```shell script
        agent-finder "Los Angeles, CA" --filename foo.csv --radius 50
        ```
