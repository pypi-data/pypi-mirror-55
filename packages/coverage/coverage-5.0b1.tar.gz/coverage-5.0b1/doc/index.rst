Coverage.py
===========

Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It
monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then
analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.

Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It
can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are
not.

Quick start
-----------

Getting started is easy:

#.  Install coverage.py from the `coverage.py page on the Python Package Index`_,
    or by using "pip install coverage".  For a few more details, see
    :ref:`install`.

#.  Use ``coverage run`` to run your program and gather data:

    .. code-block:: console

        # if you usually do:
        #
        #   $ python my_program.py arg1 arg2
        #
        # then instead do:

        $ coverage run my_program.py arg1 arg2
        blah blah ..your program's output.. blah blah

#.  Use ``coverage report`` to report on the results:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ coverage report -m
        Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
        -------------------------------------------------------
        my_program.py                20      4    80%   33-35, 39
        my_other_module.py           56      6    89%   17-23
        -------------------------------------------------------
        TOTAL                        76     10    87%

#.  For a nicer presentation, use ``coverage html`` to get annotated HTML
    listings detailing missed lines:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ coverage html

    .. ifconfig:: not prerelease

        Then open htmlcov/index.html in your browser, to see a
        `report like this`_.

    .. ifconfig:: prerelease

        Then open htmlcov/index.html in your browser, to see a
        `report like this one`_.

Using coverage.py
-----------------

There are a few different ways to use coverage.py.  The simplest is the
:ref:`command line <cmd>`, which lets you run your program and see the results.
If you need more control over how your project is measured, you can use the
:ref:`API <api>`.

Some test runners provide coverage integration to make it easy to use
coverage.py while running tests.  For example, `pytest`_ has the `pytest-cov`_
plugin.

You can fine-tune coverage.py's view of your code by directing it to ignore
parts that you know aren't interesting.  See :ref:`source` and :ref:`excluding`
for details.
