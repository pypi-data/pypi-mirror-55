"""
This is the core module of the library, containing the primary interface over the functionality of bcp. Along with its
dependencies on Connection and DataFile, it serves as the entry point to the library. Simply create a Connection, pass
it in to the BCP object, and then use load() or dump() to read data into and out of a database. See the methods below
for examples.

class BCP:
    """
    This is the interface over dialect-specific classes that provides generic methods to load/dump data to/from a
    database.

    Args:
        connection: a Connection object that contains authorization details and database details

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        This method provides an interface to the lower level dialect-specific BCP load classes.

            input_file: the file to be loaded into the database
            table: the table in which to land the data

        Returns:
             the name of the table that contains the data
