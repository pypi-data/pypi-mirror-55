## The Name

**EMT** stands for _Esecutore di Macchine di Turing_, that is the Italian for _"Turing Machine Executor"_.

## The Reasons

To be completely honest I was just really bored and I needed a way to spend my time while learning new languages. I written this code in Python because I wanted to try using what I learnt about this language in the past months.

## How To Use EMT

Visit the [Wiki page](https://github.com/espositoandrea/Turing-Machine-Executor/wiki/How-To-Use-EMT) to know how to use EMT.

## Known Bugs and Limitations

In this section there's a list of known bugs and limitations of EMT. For future reference, if a bug is solved (or if a limitation is removed) it won't be deleted from this list, but it will be just marked as "deleted" (like ~~this~~).

- This executor can only start right before the input string
- You can't execute the same machine with more than one input tape without reinserting the machine
- This executor is not much _user friendly_
