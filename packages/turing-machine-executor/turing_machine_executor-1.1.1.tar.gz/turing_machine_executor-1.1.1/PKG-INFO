        A simple executor of _(almost)_ every Turing machine.

        ## The Name
        
        **EMT** stands for _Esecutore di Macchine di Turing_, that is the Italian for _"Turing Machine Executor"_.
        
        ## The Reasons
        
        To be completely honest I was just really bored and I needed a way to spend my time while learning new languages. I written this code in Python because I wanted to try using what I learnt about this language in the past months.
        
        ## How To Use EMT
        
        Visit the [Wiki page](https://github.com/espositoandrea/Turing-Machine-Executor/wiki/How-To-Use-EMT) to know how to use EMT.
        
        ## Known Bugs and Limitations
        
        In this section there's a list of known bugs and limitations of EMT. For future reference, if a bug is solved (or if a limitation is removed) it won't be deleted from this list, but it will be just marked as "deleted" (like ~~this~~).
        
        - This executor can only start right before the input string
        - You can't execute the same machine with more than one input tape without reinserting the machine
        - This executor is not much _user friendly_
