text="The human " + SupWSD.SENSE_TAG + "brain" + SupWSD.SENSE_TAG + " is quite proficient at word-sense disambiguation. The fact that natural language is formed "+ SupWSD.SENSE_TAG+"in a way"+ SupWSD.SENSE_TAG+" that requires so much of it is a " + SupWSD.SENSE_TAG + "reflection" + SupWSD.SENSE_TAG + " of that neurologic reality."

for result in SupWSD('apiKey').disambiguate(text,Language.EN,Model.SEMCOR_OMSTI_ONESEC_WORDNET):
        token=result.token
        print("Word: {}\tLemma: {}\tPOS: {}\tTag: {}".format(token.word, token.lemma,token.pos,token.tag))

        if not result.miss():
            for sense in result.senses:
