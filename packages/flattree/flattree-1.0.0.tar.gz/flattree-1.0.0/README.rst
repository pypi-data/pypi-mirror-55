FlatTree
========

FlatTree is a lightweight tool that implements basic operations
on nested Python dictionaries, "trees".

It allows to

- merge trees into single tree
- access leaf nodes and branches using path-like "flat" keys
- use aliases for keys
- assign to or delete leaves or branches

For more information please refer to
`documentation on readthedocs <http://flattree.readthedocs.io/>`_.
