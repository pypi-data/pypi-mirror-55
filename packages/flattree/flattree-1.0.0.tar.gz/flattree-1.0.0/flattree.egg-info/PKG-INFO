Description: FlatTree
        ========
        
        FlatTree is a lightweight tool that implements basic operations
        on nested Python dictionaries, "trees".
        
        It allows to
        
        - merge trees into single tree
        - access leaf nodes and branches using path-like "flat" keys
        - use aliases for keys
        - assign to or delete leaves or branches

        `documentation on readthedocs <http://flattree.readthedocs.io/>`_.
