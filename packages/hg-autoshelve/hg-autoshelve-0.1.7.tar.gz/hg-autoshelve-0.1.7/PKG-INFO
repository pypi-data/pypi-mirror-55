Description: ========================================================
        Automatic dirty working directory shelving for Mercurial
        ========================================================
        
        AutoShelve is a Mercurial extension that shelves modified files
        before applying changes to the repository then unshelve them.
        
        Why would I use it ?
        
        I not sure that there is a valid reason for using it. But it's a
        pragmatic solution for durty use cases. Autoshelve will avoid you
        wasting time until you meet and find a good solution.
        
        Note:
              Shelve operations may be very long for certain repositories. In
              this cases you may want to disable or enable autoshelve in the
              configuration file of the repository.
