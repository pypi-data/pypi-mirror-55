Automatic dirty working directory shelving for Mercurial
========================================================

AutoShelve is a Mercurial extension that shelves modified files
before applying changes to the repository then unshelve them.

Why would I use it ?

I not sure that there is a valid reason for using it. But it's a
pragmatic solution for durty use cases. Autoshelve will avoid you
wasting time until you meet and find a good solution.

Note:
      Shelve operations may be very long for certain repositories. In
      this cases you may want to disable or enable autoshelve in the
      configuration file of the repository.


Installation
============

Install hg-autoshelve using ``pip``::

  pip install hg-autoshelve


Then enable the extension in your `mercurial configuration file
<https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/hgrc.5.html#files>`_::
