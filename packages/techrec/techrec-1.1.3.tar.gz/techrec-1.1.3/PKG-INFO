        =======
        
        A Python2 web application that assist radio speakers in recording their shows.
        Meant to be simple to install and to maintain.
        
        It basically takes a directory with the continuous recording and create new
        files "cutting/pasting" with ffmpeg.
        
        Features
        =========
        
        * little system dependencies: python2 and ffmpeg
        * The interface is extremely simple to use
        * You can have nested recording (ie: to record an interview inside of a whole
          show)
        * There is no user system: any user opening the website will see the complete
          status of the applications. There is, also, nothing stored in cookie or
          similar mechanisms. This means that recording a session does not require a
          browser to remain open, or any kind of persistence client-side: server-side
          does it all. It also means that authorization must be done on another layer
          (for example, your webserver could add a Basic Auth)
        
        How does it work
        ================
        
        We suppose that you have a continous recording of your radio broadcasting.
        What techrec does is taking files from this directory and "cutting/pasting"
        parts of them. This can boil down to something like
        
        ```sh
        ffmpeg -i concat:2014-20-01-00-00.mp3|2014-20-01-00-01.mp3 -acodec copy -ss 160 -t 1840 foo.mp3
        ```
        
        
        Implementation details
        ======================
        
        It is based on bottle, to get a minimal framework. Simple APIs are offered
        through it, and the static site uses them.
        
        Jobs are not dispatched using stuff like celery, but with a thin wrapper over
        `multiprocessing.Pool`; this is just to keep the installation as simple as
        possible.
        
        The encoding part is delegated to `ffmpeg`, but the code is really modular so
        changing this is a breeze. To be quicker and avoid the quality issues related
        to reencoding, the codec "copy" is used: this means that input and output must
        have the same format.
