This repository provides **UNOFFICIAL** [Parallel WaveGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11480) implementation with Pytorch.

You can check our samples in [our demo HP](https://kan-bayashi.github.io/ParallelWaveGAN)!

The goal of this repository is to provide the real-time neural vocoder which is compatible with [ESPnet-TTS](https://github.com/espnet/espnet).

## Requirements

This repository is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with a GPU Titan V.

- Python 3.6+
- Cuda 10.0
- CuDNN 7+
- NCCL 2+ (for distributed multi-gpu training)

All of the codes are tested on Pytorch 1.0.1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.

## Setup

You can select the installation method from two alternatives.

### A. Use pip

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN.git
$ cd ParallelWaveGAN
$ pip install -e .
```

### B. Make virtualenv

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN.git
$ cd ParallelWaveGAN/tools
$ make
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

## Run

This repository provides [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi)-style recipes, as the same as [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet).  
Currently, four recipes are supported.

- [CMU Arctic](http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/): English speakers
- [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/): English female speaker
- [JSUT](https://sites.google.com/site/shinnosuketakamichi/publication/jsut): Japanese female speaker
- [CSMSC](https://www.data-baker.com/open_source.html): Mandarin female speaker

To run the recipe, please follow the below instruction.

```bash
# Let us move on the recipe directory
$ cd egs/ljspeech/voc1

# Run the recipe from scratch
$ ./run.sh

# You can change config via command line
$ ./run.sh --conf <your_customized_yaml_config>

# You can select the stage to start and stop
$ ./run.sh --stage 2 --stop_stage 2

# If you want to specify the gpu
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 ./run.sh --stage 2
```

The integration with job schedulers such as [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) can be done via `cmd.sh` and  `conf/slurm.conf`.  
If you want to use it, please check [this page](https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/queue.html).

All of the hyperparameters is written in a single yaml format configuration file.  
Please check [this example](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN/blob/master/egs/ljspeech/voc1/conf/parallel_wavegan.v1.yaml) in ljspeech recipe.

The training requires ~3 days with a single GPU (TITAN V).  
The speed of the training is 0.5 seconds per an iteration, in total ~ 200000 sec (= 2.31 days).  
You can monitor the training progress via tensorboard.

```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir exp
```

If you want to accelerate the training, you can try distributed multi-gpu training based on apex.  
First, you need to install apex. please follow the instruction (https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex).  
After the installation, you can try distributed multi-gpu training via following command:

```bash
# in the case of the number of gpus = 8
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" ./run.sh --stage 2 --n_gpus 8
```

In the case of distributed training, batch size will be automatically multiplied by the number of gpus.  
Please be careful.

The decoding speed is RTF = 0.016 with TITAN V, much faster than the real-time.

```bash
[decode]: 100%|██████████| 250/250 [00:30<00:00,  8.31it/s, RTF=0.0156]
2019-11-03 09:07:40,480 (decode:127) INFO: finished generation of 250 utterances (RTF = 0.016).
```

Even on the CPU (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6154 CPU @ 3.00GHz 16 threads), it can generate less than the real-time.

```bash
[decode]: 100%|██████████| 250/250 [22:16<00:00,  5.35s/it, RTF=0.841]
2019-11-06 09:04:56,697 (decode:129) INFO: finished generation of 250 utterances (RTF = 0.734).
```

## Results
You can listen to the samples and download pretrained models at [our google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sd_QzcUNnbiaWq7L0ykMP7Xmk-zOuxTi).  

The training is still on going. Please check the latest progress at https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN/issues/1.
