The python interface classes for VitaOptimum
============================================

VitaOptimum is a library which solvers are designed to find a globally best solution of non-linear models in the possible or known presence of multiple local optima and constraints. The python package contains interface classes for the library. VitaOptimum Library efficiently handles any type of arguments to optimize including continuous, mixed-variables, combinatorial permutations, integer or binary. It can deal with any type of constraints: boundary, equality or inequality ones. The library gives freedom to express models in a language that are closer to reality, which makes the final solution closer to reality.

There are many fields of their application, for example:

* Advanced Engineering Design
* Data Analysis
* Financial Forecasting
* Portfolio and Risk Management
* Process Control
* Robot Design
* Packing
* Logistics
* Telecommunications
* System Biology
* Computational Physics and Chemistry
* Biotechnology
* Advanced Statistics
* Scientific Modeling
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine and Deep Learning
* etc.

In order to use the python interface VO or VOPlus library is needed. It can be downloaded from the official web site (see links below). Also a license file is needed in order to use the library. The license file can be requested via email vo@skyworkflows.com along with a short description of your research.
