Description: # TNotes
        Program for quick terminal-based notes.
        
        ## Usage
        
        After installing create/choose a note with `$ tnotes note [note name]` (default is firstnote, and folders are accepted).
        
        To create a note entry, simply `$ t [your note]`
        
        To modify it, just `$ tt [index]` where the index starts from 0 (last entry). If no index is entered, default is 0.
        
        To save it, `$ tnotes save [filename]`
        
        To change any of the settings, `$ tnotes config [config name] [new value]` (config file in .tnotes)
        
        Note: Every entry is saved with a timestamp, and modifications do not delete the old version, which can be accessed in the tnotes folder (in home)
