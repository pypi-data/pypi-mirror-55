Description: # NextCODE Command Line Interface
        
        Introduction... What is the CLI all about and what can it do.
        
        # Requirements
         * Python 3.7
        
        # Installation
        To install the package you have to run the following command:
        ```bash
        $ pip3 install nextcode-cli -U
        ```
        
        ## Developer installation
        
        Start by pulling the sourcecode from git (usually from develop to be on the bleeding edge).
        
        There are two ways to set up the CLI. We recommend trying to install it into your system python in `develop` mode by simply running the following command in the nextcode-cli folder (depending on your system setup you might need `sudo`)
        ```bash
        $ pip3 install -e . --user
        ```
        
        If you get any errors you can set up a local virtualenv in the nextcode-cli path:
        ```bash
        $ source ./setup.sh
        $ pip3 install -e .
        ```
        Using this method means that you will always need to do `source ./setup.sh` to enter the virtualenv before using the tool, so we would recommend getting the first method to work unless you intend on make edits to the code yourself.
        
        ## Set up a service profile
        ### Create a service profile
        For any work to happen a service profile must be defined. One example is the one here below, which is Platform Dev test specific. For QA purposes this is of course **test environment dependent**!:
        
        The command is:
        ```bash
        $ nextcode profile add <profile-name>
        ```
        
        You can also set up the profile without a prompt like this:
        ```bash
        $ nextcode profile add <profile-name> --domain=mydomain.wuxinextcode.com
        ```
        
        ### View the new profile
        The command is:
        ```bash
        $ nextcode profile view <profile-name>
        ```
        
        ### Use the new profile
        
        To enable the profile as default, it must be set.
        ```bash
        $ nextcode profile set <new profile name>
        ```
        Output similar to the one below is to be expected. Notice that the  Current profile  status has changed.
        
        ### Get an API-key
        
        This is simple  - if your service profile definition works. Simply enter
        ```bash
        $ nextcode login
        ```
        and you are forwarded to the API key webpage (the Developer Console) where you authenticate and your authentication key is displayed for you to grab.
        
        ### Running the CLI for the first time
        
        Once your installation has succeeded you can run the following command anywhere in your system:
        ```bash
        nextcode status
        ```
        Once you finish the authentication process you should be able to view pipeline jobs:
        ```bash
        nextcode pipelines jobs --latest
        ```
