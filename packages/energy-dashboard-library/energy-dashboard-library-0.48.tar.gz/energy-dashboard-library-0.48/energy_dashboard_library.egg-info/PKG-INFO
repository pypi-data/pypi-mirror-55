Description: # Energy Dashboard Library (EDL)
        
        This is a collection of common library functions used by the [Energy
        Dashboard](https://github.com/energy-analytics-project/energy-dashboard), a
        project of the [Energy Analytics
        Project](https://github.com/energy-analytics-project).
        
        ## Overview
        
        Common utility functions are used by:
        
        * [energy-dashboard-cli](https://github.com/energy-analytics-project/energy-dashboard-client)
        * [data feeds](https://github.com/energy-analytics-project/energy-dashboard/data)
        * [feed generator](https://github.com/energy-analytics-project/data-source-template)
        
        This is probably only interesting to project maintainers. Tool users will want
        to look at
        [energy-dashboard-cli](https://github.com/energy-analytics-project/energy-dashboard-client).
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        * [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/)
        * [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html)
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ```bash
        # only required the first time around, creates a conda environment named 'eap-dev'
        make setup
        
        # activate the created conda environment
        conda activate eap-dev
        
        # build
        make build
        ```
        
        ## Publishing
        
        * Ensure that you have a valid account and that your account has permissions to push to this project.
        * Ensure that your `~/.pypirc` file is up to date. Note that I'm using auth tokens below:
        
        ```text
        [distutils]
        index-servers=
            pypi
            testpypi
        
        [testpypi]
        repository: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
        username: __token__
        password: pypi-...elided...
        
        [pypi]
        username: __token__
        password: pypi-...elided...
        ```
        
        * Publish to test first
        
        ```bash
        # publish
        make test-publish
        ```
        
        * If that worked, then publish to prod
        
        ```bash
        # publish
        make prod-publish
        ```
