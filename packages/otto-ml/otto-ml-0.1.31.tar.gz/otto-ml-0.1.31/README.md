# OTTO
Otto is a simple Boilerplate for Machine Learning projects integrated with MLflow that creates a basic directory structure to organize your code and data.
Otto is strongly based on [Cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), if you need something more complete is a good desition to visit they repo.

## Usage

Simple install otto using pip as follows

`pip install otto-ml`

and use otto

`otto --name new-project`

or simple use it with out params and let otto guides you ðŸ˜‰

`otto`

and that's it, Now you can jump to code your model! 

## Ok, but... what this solve?

That is a pretty good question. The first attempt is to simplify the startup of a new machine learning project generating most, not machine-learning related code. Like the configuration of the docker image via `Dockerfile` or the `MLProject` setup and the connection with the Mlflow tracking server if you have set up one using ENV variables. 

But to make it cristal water, let show how it will be a standard use of the `otto` package.
