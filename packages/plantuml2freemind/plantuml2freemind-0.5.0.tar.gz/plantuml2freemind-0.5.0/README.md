# plantuml2freemind


Converts plantuml mindmaps to FreeMind .mm files.

Created especially for [Teamlead Roadmap](https://github.com/tlbootcamp/tlroadmap) project, which stores and
maintains a big community-driven roadmap in a mindmap. It's very convenient to have text plantuml as a source
format and generate other required formats from it.
