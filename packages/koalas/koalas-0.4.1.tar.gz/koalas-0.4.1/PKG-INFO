Description: 
        Koalas makes data scientists more productive when interacting with big data,
        by augmenting Apache Spark's Python DataFrame API to be compatible with
        Pandas'.
        
        Pandas is the de facto standard (single-node) dataframe implementation in
        Python, while Spark is the de facto standard for big data processing.
        With this package, data scientists can:
        
        - Be immediately productive with Spark, with no learning curve, if one
          is already familiar with Pandas.
        - Have a single codebase that works both with Pandas (tests, smaller datasets)
          and with Spark (distributed datasets).
