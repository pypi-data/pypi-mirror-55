Description: # python_tk_oddbox
        A few odd tkinter utilities.
        
        ### Basic Description
        * Images class--supports PhotoImages organized by file stem names they were loaded from.
        * ImageMenuButton--uses images so loaded to make an image based menubutton/menu
        with an associated StringVar control variable. The user can select an image and
        its name will be set in the StringVar and displayed on the button. If the StringVar
        is set, the image displayed on button will change automatically--but it should always
        be a name of an image in Images.
        
        ### CAVEATS
        1) The package is likely too specific in focus to be useful to many.
        1) Backwards compatibility is not expected to be maintained.
        2) This code is probably never going to be production grade and very little maintenance is anticipated.
        
        #### Example Usage of Images class
        
        This example assumes the following directory structure
        ```
        /directory/path
            lion.jpg
            tiger.jpg
            bear.gif
            some.txt
        ```
        The following code will load lion, tiger, and bear as PhotoImages
        that are accessible as Images.bear and Images.flower. The
        some.txt file is ignored because we don't load the directory
        with ".txt". Then it will create a menubutton that will select
        between lion, tiger, and bear based on images. The value of
        the text variale animal will be bound to this menubutton such
        that changing it will change the image on the button and
        selecting an image will change the text variable.
        ```python
        from tkinter import Tk, Label, StringVar
        from tk_oddbox import Images, ImageLoader, ImageMenuButton
        
        tk = Tk()
        
        loader = ImageLoader(tk)
        
        loader.load_dir("/directory/path", "*.jpg")
        loader.load_dir("/directory/path", "*.gif")
        
        flower_label = Label(image=Images.flower)
        bear_label = Label(image=Images.bear)
        
        animal_var = StringVar
        animal_var.set("lion")
        animal_choices = ["lion", "tiger", "bear"]
        
        animal_menu = ImageMenuButton(tk, animal_var, animal_choices) 
        
        animal_menu.grid(row=0, column=0)
        
        tk.mainloop()
        ```
        The expressions like "*.gif" are glob expressions and are
        passed to the Path.glob() method in the pathlib module.
        
        ##### Caveats:
         * Files are keyed by their stem name, so care should be
         used to avoid name collisions.
         * File stem names starting with underscores or which are not
         valid python identifiers should be avoided.
         * StringVar control variable associated with an ImageMenuButton
         should never be set to something other than a name in Images.
         This means an Entry widget with this StringVar is probably a
         bad idea.
