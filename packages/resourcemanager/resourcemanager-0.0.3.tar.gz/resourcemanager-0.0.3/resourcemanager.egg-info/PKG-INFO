Description: **resourcemanager:** A resource file manager for Python programs
        
        **STATUS**: IN DEVELOPMENT
        
        It provides:  
          * Centralized control of loading and updating resources

        Original use case:  
          * Python program with various text file resources that need to be loaded/updated
          * Each resource belongs to a package that has a function for loading it from specified file or data
          * I wanted to centralize management of these resources
