Run multiple python linters easily.

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Install with **pip**:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install multilint

Run with:

.. code-block:: sh

    multilint

Python 3.5-3.8  supported.

How It Works
------------

I like to keep my projects tidy with a standard set of linters. Running them
all turned out to be easier with a wrapper script, which I ended up
copy-pasting between them all. This project stops me needing to copy/paste,
centralizing running all these neat tools.

In order, it will check if these linters are installed, and if so, run them:

* `Black <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`_, to autoformat code
* `Flake8 <https://pypi.org/project/flake8/>`_, to check code quality
* `Isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`_, in 'diff' mode to show where imports aren't sorted
* `Modernize <https://pypi.org/project/modernize/>`_, in 'diff' mode to show where python 2/3 compatibility with
  ``six`` is missing

If any of them fail, ``multilint`` stops and dies with a non-zero exit code.
Otherwise it succeeds!

You need to configure the paths that will be linted (by default, only
``setup.py`` is linted). Put a section in your ``setup.cfg`` like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [tool:multilint]
    paths = my_package
            tests
            setup.py

You can also pass the paths as arguments to ``multilint``, which will override
the ``settings``, like:

.. code-block:: sh

    multilint path/my_file.py path/folder1

**Note:** previously ``multilint`` supported running ``setup.py check`` if you
passed a ``setup.py`` file. This was removed as the command is deprecated. You
should instead use ``twine check`` as per the `python packaging documentation
<https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme#validating-restructuredtext-markup>`__.

Usage With ``tox``
------------------

I normally run my tests with ``tox``. An example ``tox.ini`` to use
``multilint`` to run your tests on Python 3.5-3.8 and do your linting on Python
3.8 would look like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [tox]
    envlist =
        py{35,36,37,38},
        py38-codestyle

    [testenv]
    deps = -rrequirements.txt
    commands = pytest

    [testenv:py38-codestyle]
    commands = multilint

Then just put ``multilint``, plus the linters you want it to run (e.g.
``flake8``) in your ``requirements.txt``.

History

4.1.0 (2019-11-15)
------------------

.. Modify the below with new release notes

* Support Python 3.8.
* Converted setuptools metadata to configuration file. This meant removing the
  ``__version__`` attribute from the package. If you want to inspect the
  installed version, use
  ``importlib.metadata.version("multilint")``
  (`docs <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.metadata.html#distribution-versions>`__ /
  `backport <https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/>`__).

4.0.0 (2019-08-11)
------------------

* Drop ``setup.py check`` support since ``twine check`` is the new, more
  complete, recommended way of checking distributable file correctness, as per
  the warning:

  .. code-block:: sh

      warning: Check: This command has been deprecated. Use `twine check`
      instead: https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme#validating-restructuredtext-markup


  ``multilint`` can't run ``twine check`` since it needs running on your
  ``dist`` files instead of the ``setup.py`` file.

  You can integrate it on a typical ``tox`` setup with an extra command
  ``tox dist/*``. For more information see the `twine check
  documentation <https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#twine-check>`__ and
  the `packaging documentation
  <https://packaging.python.org/guides/making-a-pypi-friendly-readme#validating-restructuredtext-markup>`__.

3.0.0 (2019-05-13)
------------------

* Drop Python 2 and 3.4 support, only Python 3.5+ is supported now.
* Add support for running `Black <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`__, the
  Python code auto-formatter.
* Drop support for Flake8 < 3.0.0.

2.4.0 (2018-09-30)
------------------

* Support positional arguments for paths.

2.3.0 (2018-04-28)
------------------

* Fix for modernize 0.6.1+
* Run modernize on the multilint codebase itself, so it now requires six

2.2.1 (2018-03-08)
------------------

* Fix crash when setup.cfg doesn't exist.

2.2.0 (2017-09-19)
------------------

* Add ``--skip`` argument which can be used to skip particular linters even
  though they're installed.

2.1.0 (2017-06-02)
------------------

* Use ``entry_points`` in ``setup.py`` instead of ``scripts``
* Support ``python -m multilint``

2.0.2 (2016-12-06)
------------------

* Don't invoke ``python setup.py check`` if there is no ``setup.py``.

2.0.1 (2016-10-20)
------------------

* Remove default for `paths` in ``setup.cfg``.
* Check that paths exist before running the linters.

2.0.0 (2016-09-24)
------------------

* Use the config header ``tool:multilint`` in ``setup.cfg``, rather than
  ``multilint``, to avoid clashing with any potential ``setup.py`` commands.
  Your ``setup.cfg`` will need updating.

1.0.2 (2016-07-26)
------------------

* Work with ``flake8`` 3.0+ which changed the way its ``main`` function worked.

1.0.1 (2016-07-16)
------------------

* Fix modernize running on Python 2.
* Run ``isort`` in the same Python process rather than with ``subprocess``
* Properly gate ``flake8`` and ``isort`` so that they run only if they are
  installed.

1.0.0 (2016-06-19)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
