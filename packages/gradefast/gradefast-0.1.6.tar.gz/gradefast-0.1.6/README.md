# GradeFast-2019

!['Gradefast Logo'](assets/gradefast-logo.png)

Gradefast is a framework whose intention is to make eYRC evaluations faster and bring a standardization across task evaluations. Most important benefit is that the test scripts can then be extended and be reused in other themes having similar tasks. Primary thought behind making GradeFast is to take care of all the boundary tasks that happen in theme evaluations and also make utility scripts that take care of other common tasks so that a lot of time is saved. Some of these tasks are downloading new submissions, iterating over each of the submission folders, easily finding files to test, comments based on criterias, uploading marks and plagiarism checking. The framework is also easy to use causing less to no cognitive load on a theme developer using it.

## Running tests

1. For unit tests: ``python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit/``
2. For integration tests: ``python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit/``

## Checking coverage

1. Install coverage.py: `pip install coverage`
2. Run `coverage run --source=gradefast/ -m unittest discover -s tests/unit/` or
   `coverage run --source=gradefast/ -m unittest discover -s tests/integration/`
3. Generate static html `coverage html`
4. `cd htmlcov` and run http server with `live-server` or `python3 -m http.server`

## Building and running documentation

### Installing required packages

1. ``$ pip install sphinx_ustack_theme``
2. ``$ pip install --upgrade sphinx``

### Building docs

1. ``$ cd docs``
2. ``$ make html``

### Running web server to host documentation

1. ``$ cd docs/_build/html``
2. Start a web server in this directory. You can use either the python 3
   HTTP server or [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

   ``$ python3 -m http.server``
