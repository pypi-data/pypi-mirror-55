# What is the PyBpodâ€™s Sound Card Module? 

The Harp Sound Card is a board developed by the Scientific Hardware Platform at the Champalimaud Foundation.

This documentation is for the Python 3 library to control the pybpod_soundcard_module module.

This module allows to generate sinewave based sounds (with or without window functions) to send to the Harp
Sound Card. This can be done using the UI available in the module, as a [PyBpod](https://github.com/pybpod/pybpod)
plugin or using the API for that purpose.

In the same manner, it also allows to send those generated sounds or sounds loaded from disk, alongside
optional metadata, to the Harp Sound Card.
