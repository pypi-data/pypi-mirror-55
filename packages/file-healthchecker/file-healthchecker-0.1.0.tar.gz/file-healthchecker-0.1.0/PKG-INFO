Description: # file-healthchecker
        
        Use this application to monitor your long running "non-web" application's health check.
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ansrivas/healthcheck.svg?token=hM6V8mr5fwQPseiFSYVi&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ansrivas/healthcheck)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### pip
        
        ```
        pip install file-healthchecker
        ```
        
        ## Use Case
        
        Lets say we have a service which needs to perform some action every x-duration.
        In python-world we would simply run it inside a while loop and invoke it every x-minutes.
        
        Now define an environment var `ENV_HEALTH_CHECK_FILE` which will represent a file creation
        in case the app is healthy. for e.g. `export ENV_HEALTH_CHECK_FILE=/tmp/myapp.is.healthy`
        
        This following snippet will perform following tasks:
        
        - Every invocation of my_application will first remove a health-check file.
        - Run the application
        - NOTE: Raise an exception in case the application is failing. Handle it outside, as show in the given example.
        - If no exception is raised, the decorator will create a file defined by the env-var `ENV_HEALTH_CHECK_FILE`
        
        ```python
        from file_healthchecker import decorator_success
        import time
        
        @decorator_success
        def my_application():
            ... doing lots of work
            ... more work
            # in case of failure, raise exception
            return True
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            while True:
                try:
                    my_application()
                except Exception:
                    pass
                time.sleep(10)
        
        ```
        With the installation another cmd-app also gets installed - `checkhealth`.
        
        How to check application's health?
        - One can simply run `ENV_HEALTH_CHECK_FILE=/tmp/myapp.is.healthy checkhealth` at regular intervals or
        - pass this command to orchestrators like `Nomad`, `Kubernetes`, etc. as a part of their health-check commands.
