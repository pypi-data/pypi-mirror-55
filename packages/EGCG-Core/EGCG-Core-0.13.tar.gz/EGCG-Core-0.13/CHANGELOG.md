0.6.5
-----
 - Fix `get_project`

0.6.4
-----
- executors now retry their job submissions upon failure, up to three times
- some log messages from notifications have been reduced to debug
- `clarity.get_sample_gender` now checks for a 'Sex' UDF before checking 'Gender'
- in `rest_communication`, the building of requests has been fixed, as below:

In Communicator.get_content, we used to build a url manually via `api_url` and pass it to `_req`. This was because we had to cast dicts to strings manually:

```python
where = {'this': 'that', 'other': None}
cast_where = '{"this":"that","other":null}'
```

However, the removal of spaces that this involved meant that any query for a field containing a space resulted in a bad query:

```python
where = {'field_name': 'with spaces'}
cast_where = '{"field_name":"withspaces"}'
```

To fix this, we now pass the query string through [params](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls), and do Json serialisation on any dict params:

```python
params = {'page': 1, 'where': {'this': 'that', 'other': None}}
query_string = '?page=1&where={"this": "that", "other": null}'
```

0.6.3  
-----

0.6.2
-----
Emergency fix in move_dir where the destination file was named after the linked file instead of the link name
Downloads


0.6.1
-----
Improve util and error handling
Add function to retrieve project from LIMS API

0.6
---
 
This version adds the ability to cancel currently running cluster jobs in executor. Also fixes a bug in util.move_dir.

0.5.1
-----

Minor version adding evenness

0.5
---

Downloads

0.4.4
-----
 
0.4.3
-----

This version add the ability to Notify a log file, through email or over Asana tasks.
It also adds new constant and allow the Configuration object to still work even when no config file is passed

0.4.2  
-----

0.4.1
-----

This version fixes a bug in `EnvConfiguration`, where it wasn't selecting a new environment properly. Two fields have also been added to `constants` for upcoming versions of Analysis-Driver and Reporting-App.

0.4
---
Bugs have been fixed in `clarity`, `ncbi` and `rest_communication`. There is also now a more flexible, object oriented `rest_communication`, where a `Communicator` object can be created with a base url and username-password or token authentication.


0.3.1
-----
This adds a new field for Y-chromosome coverage to `constants`

0.3
---
This version is able to send authentication headers in `rest_communication` transactions. It now implements lazy loading of database connections and configs, so it is possible to, e.g, import rest_communication without importing ncbi, which requires sqlite3. It also allows egcg_core.config to switch its config file, allowing client apps to do, in `__init__.py`:

``` python
import egcg_core.config
egcg_core.config.cfg.load_config_file('/path/to/a_config.yaml')
# executors, ncbi, etc, can now use the same config file as the client app
```


0.2.4
-----
Since 0.2.1, this project now stores version information in __init__.__version__. A field for EdinburghGenomics/EGCG-Project-Management has also been added to constants, and an executor bug has been fixed.

0.2.3
-----

0.2.2
-----

0.2.1
-----
This version moves the deployment from distutils to setuptools, allowing automatic installation of subdependencies when EGCG-Core is installed as a requirement from another project.

0.2
---
This version adds functions to `util` specific to finding Fastqs, that previously lived in EdinburghGenomics/Analysis-Driver.

0.1 
---
First version of the EGCG-Core package
