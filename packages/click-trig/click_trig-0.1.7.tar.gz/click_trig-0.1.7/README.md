## Usage example

Have you ever found your self saying "What's the length of the Hypotenuse of
this triangle that's before me or is in my head". Okay, you've never thought of
that. If you have, you're cool(nerd!!!). But if you've found your self in front
of a Terminal... Great news, everyone!!! Just pip install my library and type:

```sh
$ trig pythagoras 22 55
```

... and Boom! You've answered your question. WITH EMOJIS!!! Soon, you'll be able to do all
your Trignoemtric functions right from the command line too! You'll never forget
SOH CAH TOA again! It'll be in your command line! Enjoy!!! Okay, put in a lot
of exclamtion points in this README. I'll fix that someday.
