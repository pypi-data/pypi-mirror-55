## Hosted Live

This repo is hosted live on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) so you won't
have to fork, download or print anything. You don't even need Python, Jupyter
Notebook/Lab/Anaconda installed on your machine to view this repo to go
through the notebooks and code. Just click the cool mybinder badge and
you'll have access to the notebooks and code live! You'll be able to edit them
and print them if you'd like.

Will take a while to load the first time but will load quicker on the next load.
Provided I don't make major changes...

## Goals

To have an easy access to material covered at the meet up and have a live
version whereever you are.
