This package implements the 'blocks' rendering model,
by providing several transform stages that hook into ``plone.transformchain``.

The rendering stages are:

``plone.app.blocks.parsexml`` (order 8000)
    Turns the response in a ``repoze.xmliter`` ``XMLSerializer`` object.
    This is then used by the subsequent stages.
    If the input is not HTML, the transformation is aborted.

``plone.app.blocks.mergepanels`` (order 8100)
    Looks up the site layout and executes the panel merge algorithm.
    Sets a request variable ('plone.app.blocks.merged') to indicate that it has done its job.

``plone.app.blocks.tiles`` (order 8500)
    Resolve tiles and place them directly into the merged layout.
    This is the fallback for views that do not opt into ``ITilePageRendered``.

``plone.app.blocks.esirender`` (order 9900)
    Only executed if the request key ``plone.app.blocks.esi`` is set and its value is true,
    as would be the case if any ESI-rendered tiles are included and ESI rendering is enabled globally.
    This step will serialise the response down to a string and perform some substitution to make ESI rendering work.


Site layouts
============

The package also registers the ``sitelayout`` ``plone.resource`` resource type,
allowing site layouts to be created easily as static HTML files served from resource directories.
The URL to a site layout is typically something like::

    /++sitelayout++my.layout/site.html

See ``plone.resource`` for more information about how to register resource directories.
For site layouts, the ``type`` of the resource directory is ``sitelayout``.

It is possible to provide a manifest file that gives a title, description and alternative default file for a site layout HTML file in a resource directory.
To create such a manifest, put a ``manifest.cfg`` file in the layout directory with the following structure:

.. code-block:: ini

    [sitelayout]
    title = My layout title
    description = Some description
    file = some-html-file.html

* All keys are optional.
* The file defaults to ``site.html``.
* Single manifest may contain multiple ``[sitelayout]`` sections.

A vocabulary factory called ``plone.availableSiteLayouts`` is registered to allow lookup of all registered site layouts.
The terms in this vocabulary use the URL as a value,
the resource directory name as a token,
and the title from the manifest (falling back on a sanitised version of the resource directory name) as the title.

The current default site layout can be identified by the ``plone.registry`` key ``plone.defaultSiteLayout``,
which is set to ``None`` by default.
To always use the current site default, use:

.. code-block:: html

    <html data-layout="./@@default-site-layout">

The ``@@default-site-layout`` view will render the current default site layout.


Content layouts
===============

The package also registers the ``contentlayout`` ``plone.resource`` resource type,
allowing shared content area layouts to be created easily as static HTML files served from resource directories.
The URL to a content layout is typically something like::

    /++contentlayout++my.layout/content.html

See ``plone.resource`` for more information about how to register resource directories.
For site layouts, the ``type`` of the resource directory is ``contentlayout``.

It is possible to provide a manifest file that gives a title, description and alternative default file for a site layout HTML file in a resource directory.
To create such a manifest, put a ``manifest.cfg`` file in the layout directory with the following structure:

.. code-block:: ini

    [contentlayout]
    title = My layout title
    description = Some description
    file = some-html-file.html
    screenshot = mylayout.png
    for = Document,Folder
    permission = cmf.ModifyPortalContent

* All keys are optional.
* Value for key ``file`` defaults to ``content.html``.
* Single manifest may contain multiple ``[contentlayout]`` sections.
* Values for keys ``for`` and ``permission`` are only for advisory and may not
  be enforced.

A vocabulary factory called ``plone.availableContentLayouts`` is registered to allow lookup of all registered content layouts.
The terms in this vocabulary use the URL as a value,
the resource directory name as a token,
and the title from the manifest (falling back on a sanitised version of the resource directory name) as the title.

The default content layout can be identified by the ``plone.registry`` key ``plone.app.blocks.default_layout``,
and the default content layout for some specific content type with key ``plone.app.blocks.default_layout.my_type``.
The default content layout is supported by the built-in ``layout_view`` browser view for content with ``ILayoutAware`` behavior.


ILayoutAware behavior
=====================

It is possible for the default site layout to be overridden per section,
by having parent objects provide or be adaptable to ``plone.app.blocks.layoutbehavior.ILayoutAware``.
As the module name implies, this interface can be used as a ``plone.behavior`` behavior,
but it can also be implemented directly or used as a standard adapter.

The ``ILayoutAware`` interface defines three properties:

``content``
    which contains the body of the page to be rendered.
``contentLayout``
    which contains the path to the selected static content layout,
    which is used instead of ``content`` when set.
``pageSiteLayout``
    which contains the path to the site layout to be used for the given page.
    It can be ``None`` if the default is to be used.
``sectionSiteLayout``
    which contains the path to the site layout to be used for pages *underneath* the given page (but not for the page itself).
    Again, it can be ``None`` if the default is to be used.

To make use of the page site layout, use the following:

.. code-block:: html

    <html data-layout="./@@default-site-layout">

See ``rendering.rst`` for detailed examples of how the processing is applied,
and ``esi.rst`` for details about how Edge Side Includes can be supported.
