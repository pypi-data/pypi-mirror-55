        Args:
            mode (str): A string representing the mode of the question.
                Eg., 'major' or 'minor'.
            wait_time (float): Wait time in seconds for the next question or
                repeat.
            n_repeats (int): Number of times the same dictation will be
                repeated before the end of the exercise.
            max_intervals (int): The maximum number of random intervals the
                question will have.
            n_notes (int): The number of notes the melodic dictation will have.
            tonic (str): A string representing the tonic of the question,
                eg.: 'C'; if omitted, it will be selected randomly.
            octave (int): A scienfic octave notation, for example, 4 for 'C4';
                if not present, it will be randomly chosen.
            descending (bool): Is the question direction in descending, ie.,
                intervals have lower pitch than the tonic.
            chromatic (bool): If the question can have (True) or not (False)
                chromatic intervals, ie., intervals not in the diatonic scale
                of tonic/mode.
            n_octaves (int): Maximum number of octaves of the question.
            valid_intervals (list): A list with intervals (int) valid for
                random choice, 1 is 1st, 2 is second etc. Eg. [1, 4, 5] to
                allow only tonics, fourths and fifths.
            user_durations (str): A string with 9 comma-separated `int` or
                `float`s to set the default duration for the notes played. The
                values are respectively for: pre-question duration (1st),
                pre-question delay (2nd), and pre-question pos-delay (3rd);
                question duration (4th), question delay (5th), and question
                pos-delay (6th); resolution duration (7th), resolution
                delay (8th), and resolution pos-delay (9th).
                duration is the duration in of the note in seconds; delay is
                the time to wait before playing the next note, and pos_delay is
                the time to wait after all the notes of the respective sequence
                have been played. If any of the user durations is `n`, the
                default duration for the type of question will be used instead.
                Example::
                    "2,0.5,1,2,n,0,2.5,n,1"
            prequestion_method (str): Method of playing a cadence or the
                exercise tonic before the question so to affirm the question
                musical tonic key to the ear. Valid ones are registered in the
                `birdears.prequestion.PREQUESION_METHODS` global dict.
            resolution_method (str): Method of playing the resolution of an
                exercise. Valid ones are registered in the
                `birdears.resolution.RESOLUTION_METHODS` global dict.
