"""
Machine learning module for finding a minimal MLST scheme for bacterial strain typing
=====================================================================================

minMLST is a machine-learning based methodology for identifying a minimal subset of genes that preserves high
discrimination among bacterial strains. It combines well known machine-learning algorithms and approaches such as
XGBoost, distance-based hierarchical clustering, and SHAP.
minMLST quantifies the importance level of each gene in an MLST scheme and allows the user to investigate the trade-off
between minimizing the number of genes in the scheme vs preserving a high resolution among strain types.

    This function provides a ranking of gene importance according to selected measures: 'shap', 'weight', 'gain',
    'cover', 'total_gain' or 'total_cover'.
        'shap' - the mean magnitude of the SHAP values, i.e. the mean absolute value of the SHAP values of a given gene
                 (See: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions).
        'weight' - the number of times a given gene is used to split the data across all splits.
        'gain' (or 'total gain') - the average (or total) gain is the average (or total) reduction of Multiclass Log Loss
                                   contributed by a given gene across all splits.
        'cover' (or 'total cover') - the average (or total) quantity of observations concerned by a given gene across all splits.
    As a pre-step, STs (strain types) with a single representative isolate are filtered from the dataset.
    Next, an XGBoost model is trained with parameters 'max_depth', 'learning_rate', 'stopping_method' and 'stopping_rounds' -
    more information about XGBoost parameters can be found here: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html.
    Model's performance is evaluated by Multi-class log loss over a test set.
    Finally, gene importance scores are measured over the trained model and provided as a DataFrame output.

                             Data types should be integers only.

    """
    This function analyzes how minimizing the number of genes in the MLST scheme impacts strain typing performance.
    At each iteration, a subset of X most important genes is selected; and based on the allelic profile composed of these genes,
    isolates are clustered into strain types (ST) using a distance-based hierarchical clustering (complete linkage).
    The distance between every pair of isolates is measured by a normalized Hamming distance, which stands for
    the proportion of those genes between the two allelic profiles which disagree.
    To obtain a clustering structure (i.e. STs), we apply a threshold (or maximal distance between isolates of the same ST)
    that equals to a certain percentile of distances distribution; This percentile (or percentiles) can be defined by
    the user in the 'percentiles' input parameter, or alternatively being selected by the 'find threshold' procedure
    that searches in the search space of 'percentiles_to_check' input parameter (see below).
    Typing performance is measure by the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which quantifies similarity between the induced
    clustering structure (that is based on a subset of genes) and the original clustering structure (that is based on
    all genes, and was given as an input)(see: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01908075).
    p-value for the ARI is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation study (see: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329313000852)
    The analysis results are provided as a DataFrame output and are also plotted by default.

    'find threshold' procedure:
    This procedure uses an heuristic to find a suitable threshold for generating an induced clustering structure (i.e. STs).
    Its search space is the list of percentiles ('percentiles_to_check') provided as an input parameter.
    To represent the typing performance achieved by a particular threshold, we compute the ARI it results for each
    subset of selected genes and construct a vector composed of these ARI elements.
    To find a potentially more precise threshold, we runs a serial evaluation process starting from the minimal
    threshold (baseline) up to the maximal threshold in the search space.
    At each iteration, the ARI vector of the 'baseline' threshold is compared with the ARI vector of the 'next'
    (second minimal) threshold using a distance function; this function is a "non-absolute" L1 distance, i.e. it equals
    to the sum of the differences of two vectors' coordinates, when subtracting the 'baseline' from the 'next'.
    In case the distance is positive (i.e. 'next' performs better) the 'next' threshold will be defined as the new
    'baseline' and will be compared with the subsequent  potential threshold. otherwise, the search is done and the
    'baseline' is selected as the recommended threshold.


    :param data (DataFrame): DataFrame in the shape of (m,n).
                         (n-1) columns of genes, last column (n) must contain the ST (strain type).
                         Each row (m) represents a profile of a single isolate.
                         Data types should be integers only.
                         Missing values should be represented as 0, no missing values are allowed for the ST (last
                         column).
    :param gene_importance (DataFrame): Importance scores in the format returned by 'gene_importance' function.
    :param measure (str): A single measure according to which gene importance will be defined.
                          Can be either 'shap', 'weight', 'gain', 'cover', 'total_gain' or 'total_cover'.
                          Note that the selected measure must be included in the `gene_importance` input
    :param reduction (numeric): The number (int) or percentage (0<float<1) of least important genes to be removed at
                                each iteration (default = 0.2).
                                The first iteration includes all genes, the second iteration includes all informative
                                genes (importance score > 0), and the subsequent iterations include a reduced
                                subset of genes according to the `reduction` parameter
    :param linkage_method (str): The linkage method to compute the distance between clusters in the hierarchical
                                 clustering algorithm (default = 'complete').
                                 Can be either 'single', 'complete', 'average', 'weighted', 'centroid', 'median' or
                                 'ward'.
    :param percentiles (float or array of floats): The percentile (or percentiles) of distances distribution to be used
                                                   as a threshold (or thresholds) -> (default = [0.5, 1]).
                                                   Each percentile must be greater than 0 and smaller than 100.
                                                   The threshold defines the maximal distance (i.e. maximal
                                                   dissimilarity) between isolates of the same ST (cluster).
    :param find_recommended_thresh (boolean): if True, ignore parameter 'percentiles' and run a procedure to find a
                                              recommended threshold out of 'percentiles_to_check' (default = False).

                                                   'find recommended threshold' procedure (default = numpy.arange(.5, 20.5, 0.5)).
                                                   The array must contain at least 2 percentiles; each percentile must
                                                   be greater than 0 and smaller than 100.
    :param simulated_samples (int): The number of samples (clustering structures) to simulate the computation of the
                                    p-value of the observed ARI (default = 0).
                                    For the significance of the p-value results, it's recommended to use ~1000 samples
                                    or more (see- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329313000852).
                                    In case 'simulated_samples'=0, simulation won't run and p-value won't be calculated.
    :param plot_results (boolean): if True, plot the ARI and p-value results for each selected threshold
                                   as a function of the number of genes (default = True).
    :param n_jobs (int): The maximum number of concurrently running jobs.
                         (default = min(60, number of CPUs in the system)).
    :return: DataFrame. ARI and p-value (if 'simulated_samples' > 0) computed for each subset of most important genes,
