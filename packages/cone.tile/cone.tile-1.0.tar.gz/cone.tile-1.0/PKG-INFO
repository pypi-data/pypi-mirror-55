Description: Tiles for use in pyramid framework
        ==================================
        
        This package provides rendering snippets of markup organized as tiles for the
        pyramid framework.
        
        A tile is a piece of web application, i.e. a form, a navigation, etc.
        
        Splitting your application in such small and logic application parts makes it
        easy to re-use this application, simplifies application AJAXification and
        the use of same application parts in different manners.

        Usage
        =====
        
        
        Register tiles
        --------------
        
        A tile is registered similar to a pyramid view. Registration is done with the
        the ``cone.tile.tile`` decorator on classes.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cone.tile import tile
            from cone.tile import Tile
        
            @tile(
                name='b_tile',
                path='package:browser/templates/b_tile.pt',
                permission='view',
                strict=False)
            class BTile(Tile):
                pass
        
        There also exists a ``cone.tile.register_tile`` function. It should not be used
        directly any more. ``tile`` decorator attaches this function to venusian for
        deferred tile registration.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cone.tile import register_tile
        
            register_tile(
                name='a_tile',
                path='package:browser/templates/a_tile.pt',
                permission='view')
        
        ``tile`` decorator accepts the following arguments:
        
        **name**
            Identifier of the tile (for later lookup).
        
        **path**
            Either relative path to the template or absolute path or path prefixed
            by the absolute package name delimeted by ':'. If ``path`` is used
            ``attribute`` is ignored.
        
        **attribute**
            Attribute on the given _class to be used to render the tile. Defaults to
            ``render``.
        
        **interface**
            Interface or class of the pyramid model the tile is registered for.
        
        **class_**
            Class to be used to render the tile. usally ``cone.tile.Tile`` or a
            subclass of. Promises to implement ``cone.tile.ITile``. When the ``tile``
            decorator is used, the decorated class is expected as tile implementation.
        
        **permission**
            Enables security checking for this tile. Defaults to ``view``. If set to
            ``None`` security checks are disabled.
        
        **strict**
            Wether to raise ``Forbidden`` or not if rendering is not permitted.
            Defaults to ``True``. If set to ``False`` the exception is consumed and an
            empty unicode string is returned.
        
        Tiles can be overwritten later while application initialization by just
        registering it again. This is useful for application theming and customization.
        
        
        Rendering tiles
        ---------------
        
        Tile rendering with the ``render_tile`` function
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cone.tile import render_tile
            rendered = render_tile(model, request, name)
        
        Inside templates which are bound to the tile, more tiles can be rendered on
        current model and request via ``tile``
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            <tal:sometile replace="structure tile('tilename')" />
        
        
        The Tile
        --------
        
        A tile is similar to what's known in the zope world as content provider.
        
        Before rendering of the tile is done, the ``prepare`` function is called which
        can be used to load data or whatever.
        
        Further, the ``show`` flag is considered (which might have been set in the
        ``prepare`` function) and rendering is skipped if it evaluates to ``False``.
        
        
        More on rendering
        -----------------
        
        There are helper functions for rendering which pass the tile renderer to
        templates for invoking child tiles and consider redirections.
        
        The tile class provides a redirect function, which expects either a string
        containing a URL or a ``webob.exc.HTTPFound`` instance. This causes rendering
        of remaining tiles to be skipped and ``request.environ['redirect']`` to be set.
        
        **cone.tile.render_template**
            Render template. Passes tile renderer to template. Considers redirection.
            Returns empty string if redirection found.
        
        **cone.tile.render_template_to_response**
            Render template to response. Passes tile renderer to template. Considers
            redirection. Returns HTTPFound instance if redirection found, otherwise
            rendered response.
        
        **cone.tile.render_to_response**
            Renders some result to the response considering redirection. Returns
            HTTPFound instance if redirection found, otherwise rendered response.
