Description: familytreemaker
        ===============
        
        This program creates family tree graphs from simple text files.
        
        The input file format is very simple, you describe persons of your family line
        by line, children just have to follow parents in the file. Persons can be
        repeated as long as they keep the same name or id. An example is given in the
        file `LouisXIVfamily.txt`.
        
        Note: This branch version is optimized for chinese. If other language for 
              input text file is used, command option gender (-g) has to be used to
              specify words of male and female, since their default values are set
              as "男" and "女" instead of origin "M" and "F".  
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply clone the repo or install package familytree by pip as shown below:
        ```bash
        pip install familytree
        ```
        
        This script outputs a graph descriptor in DOT format. To make the image
        containing the graph, you will need a graph drawer such as [GraphViz] [1].

        Usage
        -----
        ```
        usage: familytreemaker.py [-h] [-a ANCESTOR] [-g GENDER] [-v INFOLEVEL]
                                  [-o OUTFILE]
                                  INPUTFILE
        
        Generates a family tree graph from a simple text file
        
        positional arguments:
          INPUTFILE     the formatted text file representing the family
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help    show this help message and exit
          -a ANCESTOR   make the family tree from an ancestor (if omitted, the program
                        will try to find an ancestor)
          -g GENDER     customized gender string, for example: "男,女" or "M,F"
          -v INFOLEVEL  Information level (0/1/2) to output. (0 - only name and
                        surfname will be output; 1 - time of birthday and deathday
                        will be invisable; 2 - all information will be output)
          -o OUTFILE    file name for output
        ```
        
        The sample family descriptor `LouisXIVfamily.txt` is here to show you the
        usage. Simply run:
        ```
        python familytreemaker.py -a "王灿文" -v2 -o LouisXIVfamily.dot LouisXIVfamily.txt && \
            dot -Tsvg -o LouisXIVfamily.svg LouisXIVfamily.dot
        ```
        
        If package familytree has been installed by pip, commands below can be performed to populate:
        ```bash
        python -m familytree.familytreemaker -a "王灿文" -v2 -o LouisXIVfamily.dot LouisXIVfamily.txt && \
            dot -Tsvg -o LouisXIVfamily.svg LouisXIVfamily.dot
        ``` 
        
        It will generate the tree from the infos in `LouisXIVfamily.txt`, starting from
        *王灿文* and saving the image in `LouisXIVfamily.svg`.
