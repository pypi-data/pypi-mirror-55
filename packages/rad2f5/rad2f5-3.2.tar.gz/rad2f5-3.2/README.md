rad2f5
======

This is a simple script to convert Radware Appdirector configurations to F5 configuration. This was written in Python v2.7 but is expected to work on v3.

Install using pip:

``pip install rad2f5``

Usage
=====
``Usage: rad2f5 <filename> [partition]``

Output is to stdout and shows statistics about the number of objects and then F5-syntax configuration. 
This F5 configuration can be loaded onto an F5 device using ``tmsh load sys config merge file /var/tmp/<filename> verify``. 
Fix any issues and load with ``tmsh load sys config merge file /var/tmp/<filename>``

The certificates and keys will be output into the current directory, these should be uploaded to the BIG-IP in the /var/tmp
directory and run the script check_certs.sh to ensure the certs and keys are correct, then run load_certs to load the certificates and keys.
