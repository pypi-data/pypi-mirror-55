        ## Why?
        
        Creating a PR in GitLab UI takes so much time.
        You need to click a button, select options like 'Squash', 'Remove source branch when merged'.
        You need to select minimal approvers count.
        You need to select approvers.
        You should set approvers as assignee to give them email about your PR.
        
        It is a pure nightmare.
        Just run `prman` in your repo directory.
        Type approvers like `fisher;choi`.
        It pushes your branch to the origin automatically.
        A Pull Request is done!
