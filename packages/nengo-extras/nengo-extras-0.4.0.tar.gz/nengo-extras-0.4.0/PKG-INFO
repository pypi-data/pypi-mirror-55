        Nengo extras
        ************
        
        Extra utilities and add-ons for Nengo.
        
        This repository contains utilities that occupy
        a liminal space not quite generic enough for inclusion in Nengo_,
        but useful enough that they should be publicly accessible.
        
        Some of these utilities may eventually migrate to Nengo_,
        and others may be split off into their own separate repositories.

        .. Changelog entries should follow this format:
        
           version (release date)
           ======================
        
           **section**
        
           - One-line description of change (link to Github issue/PR)
        
        .. Changes should be organized in one of several sections:
        
           - Added
           - Changed
           - Deprecated
           - Removed
           - Fixed
        
        0.4.0 (November 15, 2019)
        =========================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added ``nengo_extras.simulators.RealTimeSimulator``, which will ensure that
          simulations don't run faster than real time.
          (`#85 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/85>`_,
          `#151 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/151>`_)
        - Added ``nengo_extras.neurons.NumbaLIF``, which is a numba-accelerated
          drop-in replacement for the ``nengo.LIF`` neuron model (requires ``numba`` to
          be installed).
          (`#86 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/86>`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Fixed some Nengo 3.0.0 compatibility issues.
          (`#90 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/90>`_)
        
        0.3.0 (June 4, 2018)
        ====================
        
        **Changed**
        
        - Submodules are no longer automatically imported into the
          ``nengo_extras`` namespace, as it can be difficult to install
          requirements for the various tools in Nengo Extras.
          (`#77 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/issues/77>`_,
          `#78 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/78>`_)
        
        0.2.0 (May 31, 2018)
        ====================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added the association matrix learning rule (AML)
          to learn associations from cue vectors to target vectors
          in a one-shot fashion without catastrophic forgetting.
          (`#72 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/72>`_)
        - Added classes to convert Nengo models to GEXF for visualization with Gephi.
          (`#54 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/54>`_)
        - Added a ``Camera`` process to stream images from a camera to Nengo.
          (`#61 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/pull/61>`_)
        
        0.1.0 (March 14, 2018)
        ======================
        
        Initial release of Nengo Extras!
        Tested with Nengo 2.7.0, but should work with earlier versions.
        If you run into any issues, please
        `file a bug report <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-extras/issues/new>`_.
