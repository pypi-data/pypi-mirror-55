plotpy.core.utils.dataset
-------------------------

The ``plotpy.core.utils.dataset`` module provides various utility helper functions
(pure python).
"""


def update_dataset(dest, source, visible_only=False):
    """
    Update `dest` dataset items from `source` dataset

    dest should inherit from DataSet, whereas source can be:
        * any Python object containing matching attribute names
        * or a dictionary with matching key names

    For each DataSet item, the function will try to get the attribute
    of the same name from the source.

    Restore `dest` dataset items from `source` dataset

    the source to be a DataSet instead of the destination.

    Symetrically from update_dataset, `dest` may also be a dictionary.
