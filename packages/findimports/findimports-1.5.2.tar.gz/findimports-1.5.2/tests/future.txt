Future statements
=================

Future statements do not confuse findimports

    >>> from findimports import find_imports

    >>> with open('future.py', 'w') as f: _ = f.write('''
    ... from __future__ import nested_scopes
    ... ''')

    >>> for imp in find_imports('future.py'):
    ...     print(imp)
