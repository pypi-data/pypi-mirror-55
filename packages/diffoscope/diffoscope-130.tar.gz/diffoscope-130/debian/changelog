  * Call R's "deparse" function to ensure that we do not error out and revert
    to a binary diff when processing .rdb files with internal "vector" types as
    they do not automatically coerce to strings.
  * Add the ability to pass Python bytestrings to external commands and
    pass our long script to parse R .rdb files using this new method over a
    long command-line argument
  * Use Rscript's --vanilla option over --no-environ as this also enables
    --no-save, --no-restore, --no-site-file and --no-init-file.
  * Improve command-line error messages:
    - Split out formatting into a separate utility function.
    - Truncate very long lines when displaying them as an external source
      of data.
    - When printing an error from a command, format the command for the user.

  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Move build-dependency on python-argcomplete to the Python 3.x version to
    facilitate Python 2.x removal. (Closes: #942967)
  * Overhaul the handling of GNU R .rdb files:
    - Rework and refactor the handling of .rdb files specifically with respect
      to locating the parallel .rdx file prior to inspecting the file to ensure
      that we do not add files to the user's filesystem in the case of directly
      comparing two .rdb files or, worse, overwriting a file in is place.
    - Use a ("""-formatted) docstring for our internal R script to dump
      variables.
    - Mask/hide standard errors; R will often produce noisy output that is not
      useful to us.
    - Don't include a useless and misleading "NULL".
    - Include all R object names are displayed, including ones beginning with a
      fullstop (".").
    - Sort package fields when dumping data for output stability.
    - Format package contents as "foo = bar" rather than using ugly and
      misleading brackets.
    - Include the object's type when dumping package contents.
    - Never read the site or user's R location environment configuration to
      ensure output stability.
    - Expose absolute paths in the semantic/human-readable output, preventing
      falling back to a useless hexdump.
  * Improve the formatting of command lines:
    - Ensure newlines and other metacharacters appear escaped as "\n", etc.
    - Use the newline (etc.) escaped version of the commandline being executed in
      logging/debug output.
    - When displaying standard error, ensure use the escaped version too.
  * Add support for easily masking the standard error of commands and use this
    in the ffprobe comparator.
  * To match the libarchive container, raise a KeyError exception if we request
    an invalid member from a directory container.
  * Correct string representation output in the traceback when we cannot locate
    a specific item in a container.

  * Include either standard error or standard output (and not just the latter)

  * Fix a few unicode/bytes issues:
    - Avoid a possible traceback caused by a str/bytes confusion when handling
      the output of failing external commands.
    - Ensure that all of our artificially-created subprocess.CalledProcessError

  * Don't fallback to a (useless) raw hexdump when readelf(1) reports an minor

  * If a command fails to execute but does not print anything to standard

    - Additionally extract the classes.dex file from .apk files; apktool does
      not do this by default which was preventing us from recursing into it to
      find differences. Thanks to Hans-Christoph Steiner for the report.
      (Closes: #890904)
    - Recursively reset the permissions of temporary directories prior to
      deletion to ensure that non-writable permissions such as 0555 are removed
      and do not cause a traceback. (Closes: #891363)

    - Don't show progress bar if we passed --debug as it just gets in the way.

  * Code tidying:
    - Avoid some necessary indentation around unconditional control flow.
    - Tidy unnecessary assignments.
    - Move the documentation for maybe_decode into a docstring on the method
      itself.
    - Import LooseVersion as LooseVersion.
    - Use more Pythonic `old_level` variable names (over `oldLabel`) and avoid
      using ambiguous `l` variable names.
    - Add whitespace around operators and ensure 4-line indentation throughout.

  * debian/*:
    - Move DOS/MBR check into the testsuite.
    - Add explicit runtime dependency on python3-distutils as it was dropped in

  * Misc:
    - Clarify that the Reproducible Builds project is not just about Debian.

    + Split large diffs across several child pages.
      Also add some flags so html-dir behaviour is easier to reason about.
    + Use 4 times the given --max-diff-block-lines.
      This way, '--html x.html --html-dir y' gives reasonable output for both.

  * SquashFS test_testing:
    - Don't assume that user and group are 5 characters long in squashfs
      test_listing.
    - Drop test; simply too unreliable and/or has too many requirements to
      satisfy (eg. shorter usernames) for it to not be skipped.
  * Difference class:
    - Ensure that we pass str instances to our Difference class as paths,
      otherwise we can't be sure we can render them. For example, passing a
      class here breaks the HTML renderer.
    - Add test for type checking of path1/path2/source.
    - Pass a str for the path in the JSON comparator, fixing the HTML reporting
      of JSON output.
  * When looping over JQUERY_SYSTEM_LOCATIONS, actually use the variable we are
    looping with when performing the symlink(2) call.

    - Add manpage for trydiffoscope.
    - Write trydiffoscope console output as UTF-8, even if STDOUT claims it
      doesn't support it.
  * debian/rules:
    - Make separate calls to dh_python3 for diffoscope and trydiffoscope to
      avoid both getting the same Recommends substvar.
    - Use a pattern-based rule for rst2man-based manpages instead of

    - comparators/directory.py: Call logger.warning over logger.warn.
    - Rename diffoscope.__main__ to diffoscope.main as its not a "real" magic
      name.
    - Raise NotImplementedError() instances over NotImplemented classes.
    - Add short option for trydiffoscope --url.
    - Rewrite trydiffoscope to match diffoscope's command-line API.

    - Remove unused ``reduce`` import.
    - Reflow long PROVIDERS lookup.
  * Add .travis.yml from http://travis.debian.net/
  * Don't skip squashfs test_listing test; we can workaround it, as long as we
    have a uid 1000.
  * Drop "Testsuite: autopkgtest" in debian/control; it is added automatically
    by dpkg-source version 1.17.11.

    - add more build-dependencies to be able to run more tests at build time
    - default-jdk-headless is enough to have javap, instead of all of
      default-jdk
  * debian/rules:

  * Fix PPU detection and associated tests.
  * Use lazy extraction instead of explicit bracketing. We now rely on
    Python garbage collector to delete file once we are done comparing.
    This will make parallel processing easier to implement.
  * Make container class available on demand instead of bracketing.
    This cleanups boilerplate code, and should make parallel processing
    easier to implement.
  * Always compare container content if applicable. This removes more
    boilerplate code.
  * Call xxd like other commands.
  * Analyze md5sums file in .deb before working on data.tar. This makes
    the code more robust and is required to properly skip files listed as
    identical in md5sums while doing parallel processing.
  * Add support for package names for OS other than Debian. The --list-tools
    command-line option now supports an optional argument to display a given
    operating system. When --list-tools is called without
    an optional argument and the current operating system is unknown,
    the list of packages for all known operating systems will be displayed.
