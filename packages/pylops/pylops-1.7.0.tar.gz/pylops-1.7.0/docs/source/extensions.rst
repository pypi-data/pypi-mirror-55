Extensions
==========

PyLops brings to users the power of linear operators in a simple and easy
to use programming interface.

While very powerful on its own, this library is further extended to take
advantage of more advanced computational resources, either in terms of
**multiple-node clusters** or **GPUs**.

Two spin-off projects aim at extending the capabilities of PyLops to
such computational environments:

* `PyLops-GPU <https://github.com/equinor/pylops-gpu>`_
* `PyLops-Distributed <https://github.com/equinor/pylops-distributed>`_
