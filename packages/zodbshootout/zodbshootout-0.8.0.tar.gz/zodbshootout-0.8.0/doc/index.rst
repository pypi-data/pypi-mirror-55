 ZODB Shoot Out
================

This application measures and compares the performance of various
ZODB storages and configurations. It is derived from the RelStorage
speedtest script, but this version allows arbitrary storage types and
configurations, provides more measurements, and produces numbers that
are easier to interpret.
