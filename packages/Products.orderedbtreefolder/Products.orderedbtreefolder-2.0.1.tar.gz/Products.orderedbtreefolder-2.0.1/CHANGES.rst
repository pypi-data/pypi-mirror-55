- Removed not needed dependency on `Products.CMFCore`.


1.2.1 (2011-03-07)
==================

- Methods ``objectItems``, ``objectValues``, ``keys``, ``values`` and

  `Products.BTreeFolder2` >= 2.13.


1.2.0 (2011-03-03)
==================

- Updated to run on Zope 2.12+, thus requiring at least this version.
