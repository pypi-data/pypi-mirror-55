        ## Features Implemented:
        * Converted numerical words to digits.
            - double five == 55
            - triple nine eight four == 99984
            - one nought one == 101
            - double 'B' == BB
            - one million == 1M
        * Decontraction of words.
        * Currency representation.
        * Units Abbrevations.
            - kilometer == km
            - meter == m
        
        
        ## Examples:
        Let's have a look at some examples to gain more understanding.Below is the piece of spoken text taken for understading.
        ```
            My mobile number is double nine nine five one six seven triple one.
            The cost of mobile is 48 thousand rupees.
            It is not easy to crack UPSC examination, people do give double attempts to clear it.
            Double standards jokes aren't tolerated here.
            My weight is 54 kilogram.I live 16 kilometers away from my office.
        ```
        ### Decontraction:
        **Code**
        ```
            spoken_text = Decontraction.decontraction(spoken_text)
            print("Text after decontraction:")
            print(spoken_text)
        ```
        **Output**
