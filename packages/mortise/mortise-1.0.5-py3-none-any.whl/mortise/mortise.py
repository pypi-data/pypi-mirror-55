class State:
    """States are the workhorses of the mortise library. User states
    should inherit from State and provide
    on_enter/on_leave/on_fail/on_timeout methods (as appropriate,
    pass-through defaults are provided), and MUST provide on on_state
    handler.

    on_enter/on_leave are fired once on entry and on leaving the
    state. These methods should return nothing as they are incapable
    of affecting the transitioning of the state machine.

    on_state is the main/required method of each state. on_state
    should return one of several options:

    * None/True - A wait state, The state is waiting on some external
    stimulus (like a message).

        * Returning 'True' indicates that the state swallowed the message that
        we were passed. On the next tick, the same state will begin from its
        on_enter method. This is a transition from the current state back to a
        new instance of the same state.

        * Returning 'None' indicates that the state did nothing with the
        message (which will cause the message to be trapped by the
        encapsulating FSM). On the next tick, the on_enter method is bypassed,
        and the state will begin from its on_state method. This is a wait in
        the current instance of the state, for the right message needed to
        transition.

    * Its own class descriptor (not an instance!) - This is a retry.
    The state will transition to an uninitialized state and will
    restart execution from on_enter. Note that this is a tool for handling
    "bad input", and the FSM will not tick, and no new message will be acquired.

    * Another state's class descriptor (not an instance!) - This is a
    transition. The FSM will fire the current on_leave handler (if
    it exists) and transition to the next state.

    States may also provide TIMEOUT and RETRIES class variables.

    TIMEOUT specifies the duration of a failsafe timer in seconds that
    is started when a state is entered, and cancelled when a state
    successfully transitions. If the user has provided an on_timeout
    state, it will be called in response to this event. on_timeout may
    return None, which will cause the state machine's default error
    state to be entered, the descriptor of the current state, which
    will reset the timer, or the descriptor of a specific error state.

    RETRIES specifies how many times a state may be retried before an
    error condition is flagged (default is None (infinite)). When this error
    condition occurs, the 'on_fail' handler will be called if it
    exists. on_fail may return None, which will cause the state
    machine's default error state to be entered, or the descriptor of
    a specific error state may be returned.
