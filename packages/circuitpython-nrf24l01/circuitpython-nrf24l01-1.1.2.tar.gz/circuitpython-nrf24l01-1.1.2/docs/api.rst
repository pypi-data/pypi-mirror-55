RF24 class
==============

.. important:: The nRF24L01 has 3 key features that can be interdependent of each other. Their
    priority of dependence is as follows:

    1. `dynamic_payloads` feature allowing either TX/RX nRF24L01 to be able to send/receive
       payloads with their size written into the payloads' packet. With this disabled, both RX/TX
       nRF24L01 must use matching `payload_length` attributes.
    2. `auto_ack` feature provides transmission verification by using the RX nRF24L01 to
       automatically and imediatedly send an acknowledgment (ACK) packet in response to freshly
       received payloads. `auto_ack` does not require `dynamic_payloads` to be enabled.
    3. `ack` feature allows the MCU to append a payload to the ACK packet, thus instant
       bi-directional communication. A transmitting ACK payload must be loaded into the nRF24L01's
       TX FIFO buffer (done using `load_ack()`) BEFORE receiving the payload that is to be
       acknowledged. Once transmitted, the payload is released from the TX FIFO buffer. This
       feature requires the `auto_ack` and `dynamic_payloads` features enabled.

Remeber that the nRF24L01's FIFO (first-in,first-out) buffer has 3 levels. This means that there
can be up to 3 payloads waiting to be read (RX) and up to 3 payloads waiting to be transmit (TX).

With the `auto_ack` feature enabled you get:

    * cycle redundancy checking (`crc`) automatically enabled
    * to change amount of automatic re-transmit attempts and the delay time between them. See the
      `arc` and `ard` attributes.

.. note:: A word on pipes vs addresses vs channels.

    You should think of the data pipes as a vehicle that you (the payload) get into. Continuing the
    analogy, the specified address is not the address of an nRF24L01 radio, rather it is more
    like a route that connects the endpoints. There are only six data pipes on the nRF24L01,
    thus it can simultaneously listen to a maximum of 6 other nRF24L01 radios (can only talk to
    1 at a time). When assigning addresses to a data pipe, you can use any 5 byte long address
    you can think of (as long as the last byte is unique among simultaneously broadcasting
    addresses), so you're not limited to communicating to the same 6 radios (more on this when
    we support "Multiciever" mode). Also the radio's channel is not be confused with the
    radio's pipes. Channel selection is a way of specifying a certain radio frequency
    (frequency = [2400 + channel] MHz). Channel defaults to 76 (like the arduino library), but
    options range from 0 to 125 -- that's 2.4 GHz to 2.525 GHz. The channel can be tweaked to
    find a less occupied frequency amongst (Bluetooth & WiFi) ambient signals.

.. warning:: For successful transmissions, most of the endpoint trasceivers' settings/features must
    match. These settings/features include:

    * The RX pipe's address on the receiving nRF24L01 MUST match the TX pipe's address on the
      transmitting nRF24L01
    * `address_length`
    * `channel`
    * `data_rate`
    * `dynamic_payloads`
    * `payload_length` only when `dynamic_payloads` is disabled
    * `auto_ack`
    * custom `ack` payloads
    * `crc`

    In fact the only attributes that aren't required to match on both endpoint transceivers would
    be the identifying data pipe number (passed to `open_rx_pipe()`), `pa_level`, `arc`, &
    `ard` attributes. The ``ask_no_ack`` feature can be used despite the settings/features
    configuration (see :meth:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.send` & `write()` function
    parameters for more details).
