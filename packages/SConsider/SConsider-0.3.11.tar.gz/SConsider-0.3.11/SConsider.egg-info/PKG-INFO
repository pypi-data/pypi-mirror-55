Description: 
        SConsider
        =========
        
        SCons extension to provide a recursive target detection and dependency
        handling mechanism.
        
        Build a development version
        ---------------------------
        
        Given the fact that we use git as VCS, we can not use the tag_svn_revision
        feature of egg_info. Therefor we make use of the gitegginfo module.
        
        The following command makes use of it and creates the necessary egg-info
        directory using the current commit hash appended:
        
            `python setup.py gitegginfo --tag-git-desc --tag-build .dev develop`
        
        To uninstall a previously installed development version you need to use the following command:
        
            `python setup.py develop --uninstall`
        
        Run tests
        ---------
        
        Test can either be run the conventional way using the default test framework:
        
            `python setup.py test`
        
        or by using nose which is a build dependency of the module calling:
        
            `python setup.py nosetests --with-xunit --where tests/`
        
        The latter is required if you need to get test results in junit xml style to
        be analyzed by jenkins for example.
        
        Create a source/wheel package
        -----------------------------
        
        For a short packaging guide check this page: http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
        For a short tutorial on wheels check this page: http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
            `python setup.py bdist_wheel`
        
        To combine source distribution, wheel creation and uploading to PYPI you could use the following command:
        
            `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload`
        
        Overview of available commands
        ------------------------------
        
        To get an overview of available commands use:
        
            `python setup.py --help-commands`
        
        Help regarding a specific command can be retrieved using:
        
            `python setup.py <command> --help`

            fix overwriting CXXFLAGS from g++.py tool
        
            as scons probably assumes the g++ tool to be very early in tools loading,
            it overwrites settings we defined from within setupBuildTools.py

            here document fixed: must use tabs instead of spaces
        
            As the generateScript file itself is python formatted using spaces, the
            here document code for generating the gdb batch file was converted to use
            spaces instead of tabs. This lead to incorrectly formatted gdb batch file.

            gdb batch extension: allow background execution of gdb in batch mode
        
            supplying a second '-d' option causes the script to start gdb in batch mode 
            which allows dumping a stack trace only in case of a program anomaly

            The empty argument is to comply with the previous default. To be smart, we 
            append a little note which feature is in use.

            ThirdParty: extending CPPPATH with include dir for sys libraries
        
            - in case using a third party library installed in a non standard location,
             we try to extend CPPPATH with a matching include subdirectory
             the default is to check for 'include:inc:.'
             override the default by setting the environment variable INCLUDEDIRLIST

            PackageRegistry: getRealTarget moved in from TargetMaker
        
            - getRealTarget acts as a helper when wanting to find a real target,
             not an Alias node, from either a simple target string or an existing
             scons target

             in case of an error, we now load each tool separately to get more
             specific hints of the cause

             It is vital to fully qualify their location when using from keyword
            - functions like splitFulltargetname and others are now static methods
             of PackageRegistry

            experimental improvement for third party handling
        
            Command line example: scons iplanetLDAP --usetool=ThirdParty
            --with-src-zlib=3rdparty/zlib --with-src-loki=3rdparty/loki
            --with-src-boost=3rdparty/boost --with-src-cute=3rdparty/cute
            --with-iplanetLDAP=3rdparty/iplanet_ldap --with-mysql=3rdparty/mysql
            --with-openssl=3rdparty/openssl --with-oracle=3rdparty/oracle
            --with-sybase=3rdparty/sybase
        
            Known bugs, limitations, improvements, etc.
            * All libraries have to be configure using either --with-LIB=PATH or
            --with-src-LIB=PATH
            * If no --with-(src-)-XYZ is given, we try to configure the system
            libraries.
             But we don't copy them over in the current implementation.
            * Our third party sconsider files do all look more or less the same...
            refactoring possible?
            * '.build' is fixed in ThirdParty module because the tool is loaded before
            env['BUILDDIR'] has been set
            * Binary distributions still expect our current directory structure
            * Precompiled(Binary|Library)InstallBuilders need the absolute path.
            Because the sourceFile given is more
             a description to find the library than a real filename, it's not possible
            to easily resolve the sourceFile
             in the repository using rfile() or similar.

            use executor to get targets
        
            If multiple targets are emitted by a builder, we remember only the first
            one in our PackageRegistry. But the others will be built nonetheless
            because they are remembered in the executor. The only possibility to get
            this implicit "sideeffect" dependency is therefore through the executor.
