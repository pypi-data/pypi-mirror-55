    here document fixed: must use tabs instead of spaces

    As the generateScript file itself is python formatted using spaces, the
    here document code for generating the gdb batch file was converted to use
    spaces instead of tabs. This lead to incorrectly formatted gdb batch file.

    Change-Id: Ib1f25ff66ece6235ce7754c7a03d2b851fc3b8b5



-   2016-04-01 Marcel Huber

    gdb batch extension: allow background execution of gdb in batch mode

-   2015-09-08 Marcel Huber

    PackageRegistry: Exception handling fixed, moved static functions

    SecureHTTPSServerTest
     to not fail with our self signed certificate

    experimental improvement for third party handling

    Command line example: scons iplanetLDAP --usetool=ThirdParty
    --with-src-zlib=3rdparty/zlib --with-src-loki=3rdparty/loki
    --with-src-boost=3rdparty/boost --with-src-cute=3rdparty/cute
    --with-iplanetLDAP=3rdparty/iplanet_ldap --with-mysql=3rdparty/mysql
    --with-openssl=3rdparty/openssl --with-oracle=3rdparty/oracle
    --with-sybase=3rdparty/sybase

    Known bugs, limitations, improvements, etc.
    * All libraries have to be configure using either --with-LIB=PATH or
    --with-src-LIB=PATH
    * If no --with-(src-)-XYZ is given, we try to configure the system
    libraries.
     But we don't copy them over in the current implementation.
    * Our third party sconsider files do all look more or less the same...
    refactoring possible?
    * '.build' is fixed in ThirdParty module because the tool is loaded before
    env['BUILDDIR'] has been set
    * Binary distributions still expect our current directory structure
    * Precompiled(Binary|Library)InstallBuilders need the absolute path.
    Because the sourceFile given is more
     a description to find the library than a real filename, it's not possible
    to easily resolve the sourceFile
     in the repository using rfile() or similar.

    use executor to get targets

    If multiple targets are emitted by a builder, we remember only the first
    one in our PackageRegistry. But the others will be built nonetheless

    this implicit "sideeffect" dependency is therefore through the executor.
