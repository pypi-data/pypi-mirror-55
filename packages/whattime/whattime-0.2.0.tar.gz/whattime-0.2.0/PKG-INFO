        Checking of what kind a datetime object is: it let’s you explore whether a certain datetime object is e.g. a Sunday morning in summer or a Wednesday night in winter. It also consideres hemispheres.
        
        ## Getting started
        
        Install it with:
        
        ```bash
        pip install whattime
        ```
        
        or 
        
        ```bash
        pipenv install whattime
        ```
        
        For quickly getting started, just import the `whattime` function and explore a date’s properties (also see the [Get started example](https://github.com/grammofy/whattime/blob/master/examples/get_started.py)):
        
        ```python
        from datetime import datetime
        from whattime import whattime, Hemisphere
        
        now = datetime.now()
        info = whattime(now, Hemisphere.SOUTHERN)
        
        info.is_weekday
        info.is_monday
        info.is_summer
        # ...
        ```
        
        Besides checking all the time types you can also only check a certain category of types, e.g. info about the current day, or the time within a day seperately (also see the [Single info type example](https://github.com/grammofy/whattime/blob/master/examples/using_certain_descriptors_only.py)).
        
        ```python
        from datetime import datetime
        from whattime import week_info, day_time_info, season_info, Hemisphere
        
        now = datetime.now()
        
        # There will only be properties available concerning the week time info when using week_info():
        info = week_info(now)
        info.is_weekday
        info.is_monday
        # ...
        
        # There will only be properties available concerning the day time info when using day_time_info():
        info = day_time_info(now)
        info.is_afternoon
        info.is_evening
        # ...
        
        # There will only be properties available concerning the season info when using season_info():
        info = season_info(now, Hemisphere.SOUTHERN)
        info.is_spring
        info.is_summer
        # ...
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        * Check out the repo with `git clone git@github.com:grammofy/whattime.git`.
        * To set up the project for development you need to [install Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) and run:  
          ```bash
          pipenv install --dev
          ```
          in order to install the needed development requirements.
        
        * Tests can be run with: 
          ```bash
          python setup.py test
          ```
