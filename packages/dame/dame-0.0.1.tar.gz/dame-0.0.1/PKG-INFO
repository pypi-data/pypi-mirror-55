Description: # Dataflow Awesome Managing Engine
        
        The easiest dataflow managing framework - **currently under construction.**
        
        DAME solves/facilitates:
         - Building datasets from files / folders
         - Transforming data in the right order
         - Saving transformed data - once computed never compute it again
         - Choosing the best transformation from a few configurations
        
        Great for working with numpy, pyTorch and more.
        
        ## Vision
        
        **Technically**:
         - Compute stages:
           1. Sources - get data element
           2. Transforms - compute something out of available data
           3. Reducers - compute something on the whole dataset
         - Combining data sources
         - Compute only what you need - optimized performance via DAGs
         - Backup and cache, after stages, support for custom serializers
         - Ranking various configurations
         - (Optional) Parallel processing
        
        **Priorities**:
         - Easy to use
         - Batteries included
         - Little overhead - take advantage of fastest tools available
         - Integrates seamlessly with other tools
         - Expandable
        
        **Nice to have**:
         - Few python dependencies
         - Integrate tqdm
         - DAG output
