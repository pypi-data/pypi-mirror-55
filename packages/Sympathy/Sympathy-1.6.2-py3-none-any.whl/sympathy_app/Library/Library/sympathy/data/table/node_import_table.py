Table is the internal data type in Sympathy for Data representing a
two-dimensional data set. A Table consists of an arbitrary number of
columns, where all columns have the equal number of elements. Each column
has an unique header and a defined data type - all elements in a column
are of the same data type. In a Table, the columns are not bound to have
same data type, columns with different data types can be mixed in a Table.
The supported data types for the columns are the same as for numpy arrays,
with exception for the object type, np.object. Optional, an column can also
be given additional attributes, like unit or description.

This node uses plugins. Each supported file format has its own plugin. The
plugins have their own configurations which are reached by choosing among the
importers in the configuration GUI. The documentation for each plugin is
obtained by clicking at listed file formats below.

The node has an auto configuration which uses a validity check in the plugins
to detect and choose the proper plugin for the considered datasource. When
the node is executed in the auto mode the default settings for the plugins
will be used.
