ADAF is an internal data type in Sympathy for Data. In the ADAF different
kind of data, metadata (data about data), results (aggregated/calculated data)
and timeseries (accumulated time-resolved data), connected to a simultaneous
event can be stored together with defined connections to each other.

The different kinds of data are separated into containers. For the metadata
and the results, the containers consist of a set of signals stored as a
:ref:`Table`.

For the time-resolved data, the container has a more advanced structure.
The time-resolved data from a measurement can have been collected from
different measurement system and the data can, because of different reason,
not be stored together. For example, the two systems do not using the same
sample rate or do not have a common absolute zero time. The timeseries
container in the ADAF can therefore include one or many system containers.
Even within a measurement system, data can have been measured with different
sample rates, therefore the system container can consist of one or many
rasters. Each raster consists of a time base and a set of corresponding
signals, which all are stored as the internal :ref:`Table` type.

This node uses plugins. Each supported file format has its own plugin. The
plugins have their own configurations which are reached by choosing among the
importers in the configuration GUI. The documentation for each plugin is
obtained by clicking at listed file formats below.

The node has an auto configuration which uses a validity check in the plugins
to detect and choose the proper plugin for the considered datasource. When
the node is executed in the auto mode the default settings for the plugins
will be used.
