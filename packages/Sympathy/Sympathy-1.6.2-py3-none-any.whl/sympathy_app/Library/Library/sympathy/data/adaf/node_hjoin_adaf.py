"""
The horisontal join, or the HJoin, of :ref:`ADAF` objects has the purpose
to merge data that has been simultaneously collected by different measurement
systems and been imported into different ADAFs. The output of the
operation is a new ADAF, where each data container is the result of a
horisontal join between the two corresponding data containers of the
incoming ADAFs.

The content of the metadata and the result containers are tables and
the horisontal join of these containers follows the procedure described
in :ref:`HJoin Table`.

The timeseries container has the structure of a dictionary, where the keys
at the first instance/level are the names of the systems from which the
time resolved data is collected from. The result of a horisontal join
operation upon two timeseries containers will become a new
container to which the content of the initial containers have been added.
In this process it is important to remember that a system in the outgoing
container will be overwritten if one adds a new system with the same name.

In other terms, HJoining an ADAF with another will horisontally join the Meta
and Result sections in the same way as :ref:`HJoin Table`, and add the systems
to the list of system. The systems themselves will not be horisontally joined.
The column names in Meta and Res must have different names, or else the latest
instance will overwrite the previous. The same holds true for the systems.
