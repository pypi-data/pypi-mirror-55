The lookup node takes rows from a lookup table (upper port) in the order
defined by a control table (lower port).

In the gui you can define pairs of columns, one from the control table and one
from the lookup table. During the execution of the node, it will step through
the rows of the selected control columns and try to find a match among the rows
in the corresponding columns in the lookup table. If there is a match, that
entire row in the lookup table is copied to the output.

Since there is one row in the output for each row in the control table, the
output from this node should always be possible to :ref:`hjoin <Hjoin Table>`
with the control table. This is often a useful first step for using the output
from this node.

Rows not found lookup table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The behavior when some rows in the control table can not be found in the lookup
table depends on the state of the two checkboxes below the table with column
pairs: *Require perfect match* and *Use zero-like value instead of
masks*. By default both boxes are unchecked which means that any rows that can
not be found in the lookup table are masked in the output.

If *Use zero-like values instead of masks* is checked, unmatched rows are
instead assigned appropriate zero-like values depending on the data type
of the columns.

Examples of zero-like values for different column types:

    :float: 0.0
    :integer: 0
    :bool: False
    :text: ""

This setting is mostly for backwards compatibility and is
therefore not recommended for new flows.

If *Require perfect match* is checked an exception will be raised if row can
not be matched. So with this setting all rows in the control table must be
matched if the node is to execute successfully. This can be useful to avoid
trickier errors in later nodes.

Using an event column
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the configuration GUI you can also choose to treat one of the defined column
pairs as event columns. The event columns will typically consist of dates or
times. But can actually be of any sortable data type. Only one event column
pair can be chosen at a time.

When an event column pair has been defined, the matching is performed in a
slightly different way. Each row in this control table will now be matched with
the last preceding event in the lookup table which also matches in all other
column pairs. This means that an entry in the event column of the control table
doesn't have to have an exact match in the lookup table for there to be a
match. It is enough that there is any preceding event.
