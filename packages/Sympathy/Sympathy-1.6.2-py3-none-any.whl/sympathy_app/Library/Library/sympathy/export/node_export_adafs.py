Export of ADAFs to the following file formats are supported:
    - SyData
    - MDF

For export of ADAF to file there exist a number of strategies that
can be used to extract filenames from information stored in the ADAFs. If no
strategy is selected one has to declare the base of the filename.

The following strategies exist:
    - **Source identifier as name**
        Use the source identifier in the ADAFs as filenames.
    - **Column with name**
        Specify a column in the metadata container where the first element
        is the filename.
