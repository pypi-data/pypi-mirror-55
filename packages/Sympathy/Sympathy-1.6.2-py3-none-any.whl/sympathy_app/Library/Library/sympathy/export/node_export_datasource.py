This node handles compression/decompression of some common archive formats.

The following formats are supported:
* ZIP
* GZIP
* TAR

The ZIP format can compress and store multiple files in a single archive.
All input files will be put into an archive with the configured name.

GZIP however only compresses one file at a time. The compressed file will have
the same name as the original file, but with the added extension .gz.
Therefore you cannot configure the name.

To create an archive with multiple files, using GZIP, you have to use two nodes
in succession. In the first one you will use TAR, which creates one file
of all the input files, much like the ZIP option, but this file is not yet
compressed. So in the second node you will use GZIP to compress the TAR
archive. This results in a file iwth the extension .tar.gz.

To decompress you then do the same in reverse. First decompress with GZIP then
extract all files with TAR.
