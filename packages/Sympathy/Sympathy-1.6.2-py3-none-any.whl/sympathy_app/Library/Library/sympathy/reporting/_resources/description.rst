Building a report template makes it possible to apply different sources of data
several times with the same type of output.

The report templates are using some of the theory of
`The Grammar of Graphics <http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-0-387-24544-7>`_.
Also influenced by the book are packages such as `ggplot2 <http://ggplot2.org>`_
and `D3.js <http://d3js.org>`_ which in turn are sources of inspiration for
this report template implementation.
