The graphical user interface
============================
The graphical user interface or GUI for Sympathy for Data is the main
interface, where you can create, edit, and 	run workflows.

In the main interface of Sympathy for Data a number of smaller windows can be
displayed, where each of these windows have their own functionality. When
Sympathy for Data is started two of these windows will be displayed, the
workspace window and the node library window. These two windows are vital for
the construction of the workflows. The other windows are
more informative.

All windows, except the workspace window, can be turned on/off from the *View*
menu.

A screenshot of the start view in Sympathy for Data is shown below. In
this screenshot the workspace window and the node library window are located to
the right and the left, respectively.

.. _node_library_window:

The node library window
-----------------------
It is through the node library window that you get access to the nodes, the
building blocks of the data analysis workflows. The nodes are stored in a
tree structure and are categorized by their functionalities. The nodes are
added to the flow with drag and drop.

There are two ways of getting more information about a node in the library
window. Brief information, consisting of a short description and a declaration
of the incoming and outgoing data types, is displayed in a tooltip when resting
the cursor over a node in the library view. The more detailed documentation is
accessed by right clicking on the node and selecting "Help". A web browser will
open to display the node documentation. Documentation for all nodes in the
library can also be found :ref:`here <lib_library>`.

It is possible to add new node libraries to the node library window. These are
generally referred to as third-party libraries. When you have downloaded a
third-party library you can add it to Sympathy in the preferences dialog.
Go to the page *Node libraries* and click add. Then add the folder *containing*
the *Library* folder.


.. _`error window`:

Messages window
---------------
The *Messages* window is where all output from nodes ends up; be it errors,
warnings, or simple notices.

When a node has something to say it will add a single row to the Messages
window. This summary line consists of the node's label in the node column and a
summary of the output in the details column. If you click on the arrowhead to
the left of the node label the row will expand and show more details.

You can right-click anywhere in the *Node* column and choose *Clear* to remove
any old content from this view and more easily notice new output.

There are four different severities in the output, ranging from least to most
severe:

Notice
  Informative non-crucial output that does not affect the node's ability to
  complete its task. For messages at this level the node label is green and
  accompanied by a tick mark.

Warnings
  A node will give you a warning when it suspects that something might be
  wrong, but it is still able to complete its task. You should usually take a
  look at any warnings and judge for yourself if some action needs to be taken.
  For messages at this level the node label is yellow and accompanied by a
  yellow warning sign.

Error
  An unrecoverable error occurred during node execution. These errors are
  usually due to problems with either the node's configuration or the data that
  it received. The details can sometimes give more information about how to fix
  the problem. For error messages the node label is red and accompanied by a
  red warning sign.

Exception
  Like the *Error* level this also represents some unrecoverable error during
  node execution. The difference is that an exception is some kind of error
  that the node developer has not anticipated. Sometimes these errors can be
  fixed simply by fixing some problem with the configuration or input data, but
  it can also be that there is some problem that needs to be fixed in the
  source code for the node.

  A good quality node should in principle never give exceptions. You should
  consider reporting any exceptions you see to the node developer. The details
  for an exception will provide a stack trace which gives information to the
  node developer about where in the code the error arose. Messages at this level
  look just like error messages except for the traceback provided in the
  details.


.. _`flow_overview`:

Flow overview
-------------
The flow overview can be accessed via the view menu. It shows all subflows and
nodes in the current workflow. Click on a node or subflow to jump to that node
or subflow.

When typing something into the filter textbox only subflows and nodes whose
labels match the filter are shown. This can help you quickly find nodes or
subflows even in very large workflows.


Undo stack
----------
The undo stack shows all historical operations preformed in the active
workflow. Each operation (create node, move node, delete node, connect nodes
etc.) is represented by a row in the undo stack with new operations being added
at the bottom. If you select a specific row Sympathy will undo all operations
below the selected row, effectively jumping to a point in time just after the
selected operation was performed.
