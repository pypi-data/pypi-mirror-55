Data Privacy Notice
===================

We believe that privacy and control over private information is a fundamental right. That is why we give you full control over the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve Sympathy for Data for everyone.

In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Sympathy for Data shares, why we collect this data and how we store it.

General Policy
--------------

What do you mean by "personal information"?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.

Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information".

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information form a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.


How do we learn information about you?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We learn information about you when:

- you give it to us directly (e.g. when you choose to send an issue report); or
- we collect it automatically through Sympathy for Data (e.g., when Sympathy sends usage reports).


What do we do with your information once we have it?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.

For users in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland: see :ref:`gdpr_notice` for more information.


When do we share information with others?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
- For processing or providing products and services to you, but when we do so, we remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.
- When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
- If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.


How do we store and protect your personal information?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.


What else should you know?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are an EU based company and all data is currently stored on our computers or those from our service providers within the European Union. This means that your information will end up on a computer within the EU, and that the EU may have a different level of data protection regulation that yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.


What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online and the products documentation.
