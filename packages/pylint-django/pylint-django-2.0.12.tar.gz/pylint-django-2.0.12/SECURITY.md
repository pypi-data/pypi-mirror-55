## Reporting a Vulnerability

In case you have found a security problem with pylint-django *DO NOT* report
it into GitHub Issues. Instead go to https://tidelift.com/docs/security
and follow the instructions there.

At least one of the package maintainers ([@atodorov](http://github.com/atodorov))
is a lifter at Tidelift and will be notified when you report the security
problem with them!
