page is at https://github.com/AnyBlok/anyblok_postgres. Source code is
tracked here using `GIT <https://git-scm.com>`_.

Project Status
--------------

AnyBlok with postres is currently in beta status and is expected to be fairly
stable.   Users should take care to report bugs and missing features on an as-needed
basis.  It should be expected that the development version may be required
for proper implementation of recently repaired issues in between releases;

Install released versions of AnyBlok from the Python package index with
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool::

    pip install anyblok_postgres

Installation via source distribution is via the ``setup.py`` script::

    python setup.py install

Installation will add the ``anyblok`` commands to the environment.

Unit Test
---------

Run the test with ``nose``::

    pip install nose
    nosetests anyblok_postgres/tests

Dependencies
------------

AnyBlok / Postgres works with **Python 3.5** and later. The install process will
ensure that `AnyBlok <http://doc.anyblok.org>`_ is installed, in addition to other 
dependencies. The latest version of them is strongly recommended.
