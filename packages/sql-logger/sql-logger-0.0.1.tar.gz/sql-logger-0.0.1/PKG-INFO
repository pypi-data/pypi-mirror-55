        Log to an SQL database from multiple threads.
        
        This program allows you to log information to different topics stored in a database file, extract subsets based on certain condition, as well as converting such selections into dataframes.
        
                    
        ## Run instructions
        > Note, only tested with Python 3
        
        0. Create an account with Amazon Web Services and create a [MySQL RDS database instance](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
        
        1. Clone the repository
        
               git clone https://github.com/robotpt/sql-logger
            
        1. Install the dependencies and setup the project with your Python path
        
               pip install -e sql-logger
        
        1. Go into the sql-logger
            
               cd sql-logger
               
        1. Create a `config.yml` file in the home directory that mirrors the following. 
           If `id` is left blank, then one is assigned based on the next available `id` in the database.
        
               log_info:
                 database_name: my_database
                 id: 
               sql_database:
                 host: <url>
                 password: mysecretpassword
                 port: 3306
                 user: <user name>
                 
        1. Tests can be run with the following commands.
        
               python3 -m unittest
