Description: 
        Impartial Text Classifier
        =========================
        Text classifier, based on the BERT and a Bayesian neural network, which
        can train on small labeled texts and doubt its decision.
        
        The goal of this project is developing of simple and power text classifier
        based on transfer learning and bayesian neural networks.
        
        A transfer learning (particulary, well-known BERT model) helps to generate
        special contextual embeddings for text tokens, which provide a better
        discrimination ability in feature space, than classical word embeddings.
        Therefore we can use smaller labeled data for training of final classifier.
        
        Bayesian neural network in final classifier models uncertainty in data,
        owing to this fact probabilities of recognized classes returned by this
        network are more fair, and bayesian neural network is more robust to
        overfitting.
