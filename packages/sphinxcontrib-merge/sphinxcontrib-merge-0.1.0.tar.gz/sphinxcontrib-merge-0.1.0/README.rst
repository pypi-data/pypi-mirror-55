Sphinx extension to build documentation from multiple remote sources.

For example, you can use it to produce a consistent documentation site by merging pages hosted in different GitHub repositories.

Installation
============

1. Install sphinxcontrib-merge using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sphinxcontrib-merge

2. Add the extension to your Sphinx project ``conf.py`` file.

.. code:: python

  extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.merge']

Usage
=====

Use the ``merge`` directive to render the content of a remote file:

.. code:: restructuredText

    .. merge:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgarcia360/sphinxcontrib-merge/master/docs/example.rst

.. note:: At the current moment the extension only works with ``.rst`` files.
