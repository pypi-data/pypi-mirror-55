  Application Notice (N244) Helper
subquestion: |
    <p>This helper has been created to help someone who doesn't have legal representation (a Litigant in Person) complete an Application Notice using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice" target="_blank">Form N244</a>.
    <p>In order to use this tool you will need the following information before continuing:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>A copy of your orginal claim, showing the <b>claim number, and details of the claimant and defendant (along with any reference numbers)</b></li>
       <li>If you've completed a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees" target="_blank">Help With Fees form</a> online you will need your reference number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you intend to set out your evidence within this form itself (rather than attaching a seperate witness statement or statement of case) then you should <b>write your evidence into a document first and save it in a safe place</b>, so you can cut and paste it into this application when requested.</p>
