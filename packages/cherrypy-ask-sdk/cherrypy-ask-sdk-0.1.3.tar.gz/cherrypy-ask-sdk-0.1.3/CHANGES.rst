CHANGELOG
=========

0.1.3
-----

* Update the setup module to make it work with the latest setuptools.

0.1.2
-----

* Not actual `application` changes, but rather in the package setup.
  Modify the way we define the single source of ``__version__`` in the package,
  so that we have a replicable source distribution package (can re-generate
  itself or a wheel).

0.1.1
-----

* Add the ``__version__`` attribute in the main package ``cherrypy_ask_sdk``.
* Small changes in the package metadata (the license wasn't specified in the wheel).

0.1
---

* Initial release of the CherryPy ASK SDK extension package.
