Description: # Contentcopy
        Contentcopy merges directory contents, deduplicating files based on their content.
        
        If a file with differing contents but the same name is encountered, the copied filename will automatically have a number appended, making it easy to see duplicate filenames.
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        python3 contentcopy.py <source> <dest>
        ```
        
        e.g.
        
        ```
        python3 contentcopy.py old_pictures new_pictures
        ```
        
        Will copy all pictures in old_pictures that are not yet in new_pictures to new_pictures. After this you can safely delete old_pictures without worrying about data loss.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install contentcopy
        ```
