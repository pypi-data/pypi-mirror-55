django-moderation is reusable application for Django framework, that allows to
moderate any model objects.

Possible use cases:

- User creates his profile, profile is not visible on site.
  It will be visible on site when moderator approves it.
- User change his profile, old profile data is visible on site.
  New data will be visible on site when moderator approves it. 

Features:

- configurable admin integration(data changed in admin can be visible on 
  site when moderator approves it)
- moderation queue in admin
- html differences of changes between versions of objects
- configurable email notifications
- custom model form that allows to edit changed data of object
- auto approve/reject for selected user groups or user types
- support for ImageField model fields on moderate object page
- 100% PEP8 correct code
- test coverage > 80% 


Requirements
============

python 2.7, 3.3+

django >= 1.8 (1.7 is also partially supported)

django-model-utils


Known issues
============

- m2m relations in models are not currently supported
- For Django 1.7, a query is run for every object in a query, resulting in N+1 total queries. For Django >= 1.8 only one additional query is run for each unmoderated query.

0.2 (2010-05-19)
----------------

- Added GenericModerator class that encapsulates moderation options for a given model.Changed register method, it  will get only two parameters: model class  and settings class.
- Added option to register models with multiple managers.

- Added automoderate helper function.
- Changed moderated_object property in ModerationManager class, moderated object is get only once from database, next is cached in _moderated_object, fixed issue with not setting user object on changed_by attribute of ModeratedObject model. 
- Fixed issue when loading object from fixture for model class that is registered with moderation. Now moderated objects will not be created when objects are loaded from fixture.
- Fixed issue with TypeError when generating differences of changes between model instances that have field with non unicode value ex. DateField.
- Fixed issue with accessing objects that existed before installation of django-moderation on model class.
- Fixed issue when more then one model is registered with moderation and multiple model instances have the same pk.

0.3.2 (2012-02-15)
------------------

- Added visibility_column option in to GenericModerator class. Boost performance of database queries when excluding objects that should not be available publicly. Field must by a BooleanField. The manager that decides which model objects should be excluded when it were rejected, will first use this option to properly display (or hide) objects that are registered with moderation. Use this option if you can define visibility column in your model and want to boost performance. By default when accessing model objects that are under moderation, one extra query is executed per object in query set to determine if object should be excluded from query set. This method benefit those who do not want to add any fields to their Models. Default: None. Closes #19
- Added support for ImageField model fields on moderate object page.
- Made moderation work with south and grappelli
- Added possibility of excluding fields from moderation change list. Closes #23
- Moved ModerationManager class to moderation.register module, moved GenericModerator class to moderation.moderator module.
- Added auto_discover function that discover all modules that contain moderator.py module and auto registers all models it contain with moderartion.
- Efficiency improvement: get all info needed to filter a queryset in two SQL requests, rather than one for each object in the queryset.
- Added south migrations
- Added suport for foreignkey changes
- Add support for multi-table inheritance
- Add visible_until_rejected functionality
- Added specific initials in BaseModeratedObjectForm
- Added posibility to specify list of moderated fields
- Fixed SMTPRecipientsRefused when user has no email, when sending messages by moderation. Closes #48
