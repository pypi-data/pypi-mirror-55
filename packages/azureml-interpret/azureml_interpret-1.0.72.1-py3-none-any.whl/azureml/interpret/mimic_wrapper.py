        In most cases, the type of the model can be inferred based on the shape of the output, where a classifier

        The format for list of transformations is same as the one here:
        https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/sklearn-pandas.

        If the user is using a transformation that is not in the list of sklearn.preprocessing transformations that
        we support then we cannot take a list of more than one column as input for the transformation.
        A user can use the following sklearn.preprocessing  transformations with a list of columns since these are
        already one to many or one to one: Binarizer, KBinsDiscretizer, KernelCenterer, LabelEncoder, MaxAbsScaler,
        MinMaxScaler, Normalizer, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, PowerTransformer, QuantileTransformer, RobustScaler,
        StandardScaler.

        Examples for transformations that work::

            [
                (["col1", "col2"], sklearn_one_hot_encoder),
                (["col3"], None) #col3 passes as is

                (["col2"], my_own_transformer),

        Example of transformations that would raise an error since it cannot be interpreted as one to many::

            [
                (["col1", "col2"], my_own_transformer)

        many mapping when taking a sequence of columns.

        features, the list of feature maps correspond to the raw to generated maps in the same order as t1, t2,
