Description: Mdclogpy
        ========
        
        Structured logging library with Mapped Diagnostic Context
        
        * Outputs the log entries to standard out in structured format, json currently.
        * Severity based filtering.
        * Supports Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC).
          Set MDC pairs are automatically added to log entries by the library.
        
        
        Log entry format
        ----------------
        
        Each log entry written with mdclog_write() function contains
        
        * Timestamp
        * Logger identity
        * Log entry severity
        * All existing MDC pairs
        * Log message text
        
        Currently the library only supports JSON formatted output written to standard
        out of the process.
        
        *Example log output*
        
        `{"ts": 1559285893047, "crit": "INFO", "id": "myprog", "mdc": {"second key":"other value","mykey":"keyval"}, "msg": "Hello world!"}`
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install from PyPi
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install mdclogpy
        ```
        
        Install using the source
        
        ```
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The library can be used in two ways shown below.
        
        1) Use the root logger
        
        ```python
          import mdclogpy
          mdclogpy.error("This is an error log")
        ```
        
        2) Create a logger instance
        
        ```python
          from mdclogpy import Logger
          my_logger = Logger()
          my_logger.error("This is an error log")
        ```
        
        A program can create several logger instances.
        
        
        Mapped Diagnostics Context
        --------------------------
        
        The MDCs are logger instance specific key-value pairs, which are included to
        all log entries written via the logger instance.
        
        By default, the library implements a root logger instance.
        MDCs added to the root logger instance are added only to the log entries
        written via the root logger instance.

        Unit testing
        ------------
        
        To run the unit tests run the following command in the package directory::
        `
        python3 -m unittest discover
        `
