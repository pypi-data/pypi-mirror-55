Description: # template-test-repo
        
        An example library
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        TODO: Use this section to explain how someone would use your package in their project.
        For example: how to add the package to a project as a requirement, how to configure the
        package, how to initialize the package, and how to call it.
        
        Hacking
        -------
        
        ### Installing template-test-repo in a development environment
        
        #### You will need
        
        * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
        
        * [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
          Follow the instructions in the pyenv README to install it.
          The Homebrew method works best on macOS.
          On Ubuntu follow the Basic GitHub Checkout method.
        
        #### Clone the git repo
        
        ```terminal
        git clone https://github.com/hypothesis/template-test-repo.git
        ```
        
        This will download the code into a `template-test-repo` directory
        in your current working directory. You need to be in the
        `template-test-repo` directory for the rest of the installation
        process:
        
        ```terminal
        cd template-test-repo
        ```
        
        #### Run the tests
        
        ```terminal
        make test
        ```
        
        **That's it!** Youâ€™ve finished setting up your template-test-repo
        development environment. Run `make help` to see all the commands that're
        available for linting, code formatting, packaging, etc.
        
        ### Updating the Cookiecutter scaffolding
        
        This project was created from the
        https://github.com/hypothesis/h-cookiecutter-pypackage/ template.
        If h-cookiecutter-pypackage itself has changed since this project was created, and
        you want to update this project with the latest changes, you can "replay" the
        cookiecutter over this project. Run:
        
        ```terminal
        make template
        ```
        
        **This will change the files in your working tree**, applying the latest
        updates from the h-cookiecutter-pypackage template. Inspect and test the
        changes, do any fixups that are needed, and then commit them to git and send a
        pull request.
        
        If you want `make template` to skip certain files, never changing them, add
        these files to `"options.disable_replay"` in
        [`.cookiecutter.json`](.cookiecutter.json) and commit that to git.
        
        If you want `make template` to update a file that's listed in `disable_replay`
        simply delete that file and then run `make template`, it'll recreate the file
        for you.
