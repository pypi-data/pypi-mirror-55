Development
===========

**isbg** uses `github flow`_ and, from v2.1.0 we use `git-hub`_ to deal
with pulls and issues.

.. _git-hub: https://github.com/sociomantic/git-hub


Development schema
------------------

We should work in a ``feature/*`` branch or ``bugfix/*`` branch and it
should be attached to an **issue**. We can use ``git hub issue`` to do
it, e.g.::

    $ git hub issue new --assign USER   # It creates the issue number 2
    $ git branch feature/DESCRIPTION    # Creates the new branch
    $ git checkout feature/DESCRIPTION  # Change to the new branch
    $ ...                               # DO changes and commit them
    $ # Push the changes to github:
    $ git push --set-upstream origin feature/DESCRIPTION
    $ # Attach the changes to issue 2:
    $ git hub pull attach -c master 2 feature/DESCRIPTION

If the git hub pull command doesn't work, you can use the github
web interface to do the pull request and attach it adding ``#2`` to
the pull request.

The working and stable features should be merged to master before
a new release, and also closed. To close the user ``closes 2`` in
the commit message.


Versioning schema
-----------------

We tag the new releases as:

  ``v{major_release_number}.{minor_release_number}.{patch_release_number}``

The current version number of **isbg** is stored in ``isbg/isbg.py``

Releasing Schema
----------------
You should:

#. Update the __version__ var ``./isbg/isbg.py``.
#. Update ``./NEWS.rst``
#. Update ``./Changelog.rst``

   ``./requirements.txt`` and/or ``./requirements-build.txt``.
#. Commit it to `master`.
#. Tag the new version in `isbg github releases`_, add the news added for this
   version in ``NEWS.rst`` to the comment. Remember to add '**v**' at the start
   of the version.
