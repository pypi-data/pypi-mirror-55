nfstream is a flexible and lightweight network data analysis library.

**nfstream main features**

* **Performance:** nfstream was designed to be fast with a small CPU and memory footprint.
* **Layer-7 visibility:** nfstream dissection is based on nDPI_ (~300 applications including Tor, Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.).
* **Flexibility:** add a flow metric in 2 lines of code using nfstream plugins method.
* **Machine Learning oriented:** add your trained model as an NFStreamClassifier_.

**Use**

* Dealing with a big pcap file and just want to aggregate it as network flows? nfstream make this path easier in few lines:

.. code-block:: python

   from nfstream.streamer import Streamer
   my_capture_streamer = Streamer(source="instagram.pcap") # or capture from a network interface
   for flow in my_capture_streamer:  # or for flow in my_live_streamer
       print(flow)  # print, append to pandas Dataframe or whatever you want :)!

* Didn't find a specific flow feature? add a plugin to the Streamer in few lines:

.. code-block:: python

   def my_awesome_plugin(packet_information, flow, direction):
    if packet_information.length > 666:
        return flow.metrics['count_pkts_gt_666'] + 1

   streamer_awesome = Streamer(source='devil.pcap', user_metrics={'count_pkts_gt_666': my_awesome_plugin})
   for export in streamer_awesome:
      print(export.metrics['count_pkts_gt_666']) # now you will see your created metric in generated flows


* More example and details are provided on the official Documentation_.
