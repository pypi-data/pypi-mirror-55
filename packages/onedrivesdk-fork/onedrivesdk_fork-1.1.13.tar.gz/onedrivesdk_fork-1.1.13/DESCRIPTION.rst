Un-Official OneDrive Python SDK
===============================

This is a fork of Microsoft's project, which hasn't been fixed in many years.

In all of the places where you would type "onedrivesdk", you can use "onedrivesdk_fork" instead.

That seems to fix:

- python 3.5 compat
- pyinstaller/cx_freeze issues
