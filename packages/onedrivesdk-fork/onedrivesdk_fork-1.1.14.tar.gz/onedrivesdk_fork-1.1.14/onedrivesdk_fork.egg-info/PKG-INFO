Description: Un-Official OneDrive Python SDK
        ===============================
        
        This is a fork of Microsoft's project, which hasn't been fixed in many years.
        
        https://github.com/AtakamaLLC/onedrive-sdk-python
        
        In all of the places where you would type "onedrivesdk", you can use "onedrivesdk_fork" instead.
        
        That seems to fix:
        
        - python 3.5 compat
        - pyinstaller/cx_freeze issues
