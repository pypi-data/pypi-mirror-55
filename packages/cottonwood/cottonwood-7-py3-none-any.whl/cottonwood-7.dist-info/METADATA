# The Cottonwood Machine Learning Framework

Cottonwood is built to as flexible as possible, top to bottom.
It's designed to minimize the iteration time when running experiments
and testing ideas. It's meant to be tweaked. Fork it. Add to it. Customize it
to solve the problem at hand. For more of the thought behind it, read
the post "
[Why another framework?](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/blog/171633/cottonwood-flexible-neural-network-framework)

This code is always evolving. I recommend referencing a specific tag
whenever you use it in a project. Tags are labeled v1, v2, etc. and
the code attached to each one won't change.

If you want to follow along with the construction process for Cottonwood,
you can get a step-by-step walkthrough in End-to-End Machine Learning
