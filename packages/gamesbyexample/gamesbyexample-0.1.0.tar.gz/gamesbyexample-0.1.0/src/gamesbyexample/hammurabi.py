    print("""Game mechanics:
- The game is played over 10 years, each turn is one year.
- You start with 100 people, 1000 acres, and 3000 bushels of grain.
- Each year has 3 phases: buy/sell land, feed population, and plant grain.
- Land trades between 17 and 26 bushels per acre. The price changes each year.
- 20 bushels feeds 1 person.
- 2 bushels are used to plant 1 acre, 1 person can plant 10 acres.
- Next years' harvest is (acres plantd * random number 1 to 5)
- Each year has a 15%% chance of plague that kills half the population.
- If more 45%% of the people starve in a single year, you instantly lose.

Best ending:     <=3%% population died and >10 acres per person.
Mediocre ending: >3% to 10%% population died or >9 to 10 acres per person.
Bad ending:      >10% to 33%% population died or >7 to 9 acres per person.
Worst ending:    >33%% population died or <7 acres per person.""")
