General information
===================

The project
-----------

This project is a Python library for testing network virtual appliances.

``COPYING`` for more details.

Description
-----------

Alpy manages containers via `Docker Python API`__.

__ https://github.com/docker/docker-py

Alpy interacts with QEMU__ using Python API of the `QEMU Monitor Protocol`__
(QMP). QMP is a JSON-based protocol that allows applications to communicate with
a QEMU instance.

__ https://www.qemu.org
__ https://pypi.org/project/qmp/

Alpy gives user Pexpect__ object to interact with a serial console. The Pexpect
object is configured to log console input and output via the standard `logging
module`__.

__ https://pexpect.readthedocs.io
__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html

Alpy is packaged and deployed to PyPI. The package__ can be installed using
*pip*.

__ https://pypi.org/project/alpy/

There are unit tests (pytest__) and integration tests in GitLab CI pipeline.
Alpy is tested and works on the latest Ubuntu, the latest Ubuntu LTS release and
on `Alpine Linux`__.

__ https://alpinelinux.org/

Examples
========

The alpy library repository includes scripts and modules to build a simple
appliance called Rabbit. Rabbit is Alpine Linux with a few packages
pre-installed. Having this simple DUT allows to demonstrate the library
features and capabilities. The tests verify a few features of the network
appliance, for example:

- IPv4 routing (see ``rabbit/tests/forward-ipv4/main.py``)
- rate-limiting network traffic (see ``rabbit/tests/rate-limit/main.py``)
- load-balancing HTTP requests (see ``rabbit/tests/load-balancing/main.py``)

The tests are executed automatically in the GitLab CI pipeline.

Example network (test *rate-limit*)::

   +-------------------------------------+
   |                                     |
   |          Device under test          |
   |          rate limit = 1mbps         |

           |                    |
           |                    |

The tests for the Rabbit device share a lot of code so the code is organized as
a library. The library is called *carrot*.

Features
========

The simplest docker to QEMU networking connection
-------------------------------------------------

Nothing in the middle. No bridges, no veth pairs, no NAT etc.

Each layer 2 frame emitted is delivered unmodified, reliably.

Reliable packet capture
-----------------------

Each frame is captured reliably thanks to the QEMU *filter-dump* feature.

First-class Docker container support
------------------------------------

Alpy follows and encourages single process per container design.

Logging
-------

Test logs are easy to configure and customize. Alpy consistently uses Python
*logging* module.

Alpy collects serial console log in binary as well as text (escaped) form.

No trash left behind
--------------------

Alpy cleans up after itself:

- processes stopped with error codes and logs collected,
- files, directories unmounted,
- temporary files removed,
- sockets closed,
- interfaces removed...

... reliably.

No root required
----------------

Run as a regular user.

API documentation
=================

The documentation is published on GitLab Pages of your GitLab project (if GitLab
Pages is enabled on your GitLab instance). For example, upstream project
documentation lives at https://abogdanenko.gitlab.io/alpy.

Alpy API documentation is generated using Sphinx__. To generate HTML API
documentation locally, install `Sphinx package`__ and run the following
command::

   PYTHONPATH=. sphinx-build docs public

To view the generated documentation, open ``public/index.html`` in a browser.

Network design
==============

The appliance being tested is referred to as a *device under test* or *DUT*.

The DUT communicates with containers attached to each of its network links.

Guest network adapters are connected to the host via tap devices (Figure 1)::

*Figure 1. Network link between QEMU guest and a docker container.*

Each tap device lives in its network namespace. This namespace belongs to a
dedicated container - a *node*. The node's purpose is to keep the namespace
alive during the lifetime of a test.

For an application to be able to communicate with the DUT the application is
containerized. The application container must be created in a special way: it
must share network namespace with one of the nodes.

Figure 2 shows an example where application containers *app0* and *app1* share
network namespace with node container *node0*. Application container *app2*
shares another network namespace with *node2*.

This sharing is supported by Docker. All we have to do is to create the
application container with the ``--network=container:NODE_NAME`` Docker option.
For example, if we want to send traffic to the DUT via its first link, we create
a traffic generator container with Docker option ``--network=container:node0``.

Building a network of nodes
===========================

Network configuration operations are performed by temporary one-off Docker
containers by calling *ip* commands inside the containers.

A distinction is made between a simplified version of the *ip* binary and the
full version. The simplified version is a busybox__ applet. The full version is
shipped in the iproute2__ package.

__ https://busybox.net/
__ https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2

Here is a list of features which alpy requires but which are missing from the
simplified version:

1. Move a network interface to a different namespace ("ip link set netns ...")

2. Create a tap interface ("ip tuntap add mode tap ...")

The image which contains the simplified version is called `busybox_image` while
the full image is called `iproute2_image`.

The images must be provided by the caller and must be present on the system. For
example, set::

   busybox_image = "busybox:latest"
   iproute2_image = "debian:testing"


FAQ
===

How do I watch serial console?
------------------------------

Use *tail*::

   tail --follow name --retry console.log

The same command, but shorter::

   tail -F console.log

How do I watch traffic on an interface?
---------------------------------------

Use tcpdump::

   tail --bytes +0 --follow name --retry link0.pcap | tcpdump -n -r -

The same command, but shorter::

   tail -Fc +0 link0.pcap | tcpdump -nr-

Can I use Wireshark to watch traffic on an interface?
-----------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can::

   tail --bytes +0 --follow name --retry link0.pcap | wireshark -k -i -

The same command, but shorter::

   tail -Fc +0 link0.pcap | wireshark -ki-

How do I debug my program?
--------------------------

Use `The Python Debugger <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html>`_.

How do I enter node network namespace?
--------------------------------------

#. Get node pid::

      docker inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' node0

#. Jump into node namespace using that pid::

      nsenter --net --target "$pid"

One-liner::

   nsenter --net --target "$(docker inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' node0)"

A note about GitLab Container Registry
======================================

Many CI jobs use one of the custom images built on the "build-docker-images"
stage. The images are stored in the GitLab Container Registry.

The images are pulled from locations specified by GitLab variables. By default,
the variables point to the registry of the current GitLab project.

If you forked this project and GitLab Container Registry is disabled in your
project, override the variables on a project level so that the images are pulled
from some other registry.

For example, set ``IMAGE_ALPINE=registry.gitlab.com/abogdanenko/alpy/alpine``.
