**[Documentation](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io)**

This package consists of a small extension library of highly optimized sparse update (scatter) operations for the use in [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), which are missing in the main package.
Scatter operations can be roughly described as reduce operations based on a given "group-index" tensor.
The package consists of the following operations:

* [**Scatter Add**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/add.html)
* [**Scatter Sub**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/sub.html)
* [**Scatter Mul**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/mul.html)
* [**Scatter Div**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/div.html)
* [**Scatter Mean**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/mean.html)
* [**Scatter Std**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/std.html)
* [**Scatter Min**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/min.html)
* [**Scatter Max**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/max.html)
* [**Scatter LogSumExp**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/logsumexp.html)

In addition, we provide composite functions which make use of `scatter_*` operations under the hood:

* [**Scatter Softmax**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/composite/softmax.html#torch_scatter.composite.scatter_softmax)
* [**Scatter LogSoftmax**](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/composite/softmax.html#torch_scatter.composite.scatter_log_softmax)

All included operations are broadcastable, work on varying data types, and are implemented both for CPU and GPU with corresponding backward implementations.

## Installation

Ensure that at least PyTorch 1.1.0 is installed and verify that `cuda/bin` and `cuda/include` are in your `$PATH` and `$CPATH` respectively, *e.g.*:

```
$ python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
>>> 1.1.0

$ echo $PATH
>>> /usr/local/cuda/bin:...

$ echo $CPATH
>>> /usr/local/cuda/include:...
```

Then run:

```
pip install torch-scatter
```

If you are running into any installation problems, please create an [issue](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter/issues).
Be sure to import `torch` first before using this package to resolve symbols the dynamic linker must see.

## Example

```py
import torch
from torch_scatter import scatter_max

src = torch.tensor([[2, 0, 1, 4, 3], [0, 2, 1, 3, 4]])
index = torch.tensor([[4, 5, 4, 2, 3], [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]])

out, argmax = scatter_max(src, index, fill_value=0)
```

```
print(out)
tensor([[ 0,  0,  4,  3,  2,  0],
        [ 2,  4,  3,  0,  0,  0]])

print(argmax)
tensor([[-1, -1,  3,  4,  0,  1]
        [ 1,  4,  3, -1, -1, -1]])
```

## Running tests

```
python setup.py test
```
