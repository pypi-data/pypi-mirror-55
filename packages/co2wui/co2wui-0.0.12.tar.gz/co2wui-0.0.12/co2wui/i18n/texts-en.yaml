    welcome: CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS is backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO2 and fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 & N1 vehicles (cars and vans), specially crafted to estimate and type-approve CO2 emissions of vehicles undergoing NEDC testing based on the emissions measured during WLTP tests.
    news: <p>The use of CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS/DICE is foreseen by EU legislations 1152/EUR/2017 and 1153/EUR/2017 as an integral part of the Commission’s policy for the introduction of WLTP in the EU vehicle certification system.</p>
          <p>JRC has committed the development, update and support of CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS/DICE under an administrative arrangement signed with DG Clima.</p>
    hints: 
        run co2mpas: In this section, CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS is executed.
                Begin to choose one or more files to use as input for your CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS simulation.
                Press Confirm to proceed.
run:
    download template: Press <b>download</b> to retrieve the latest CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS input template.
    run co2mpas: To execute CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS press the button <b>Run simulation</b>.
    hints:
        why ta disabled: 'To enable the TA mode place the dice.co2mpas.keys in the DICE_KEYS folder. For further information refer to the &quot;Help&quot; of https://dice.jrc.ec.europa.eu/, point 2'
    intro: In this section, CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS is executed. Choose one or more input file(s). Press <b>Run simulation</b> to proceed.
    view results: The log of your past simulations is shown here below. You can retrieve your previous simulation results by clicking the <b>links</b> in the table.
    options:
        only declaration mode: Use only the declaration data.
        hard validation: It is an extra validation of the inserted input data. If the data do not seem legit, the software will stop the simulation and provide an error message.
        enable selector: The default model selection criteria are to use the calibrated models from WLTP-H data to predict WLTP-H and NEDC-H and from WLTP_L data to predict WLTP-L and NEDC-L. On the contrary, if the selector is enabled, the function extract_calibrated_model detects the best macro-model for prediction (from WLTP-H/L). The selection is performed according to the model’s score, which is the model capability to reproduce the input data.
        only summary: By selecting this option, CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS provides as output only the summary file (i.e. an excel containing only one row per vehicle simulated).
        custom conf file: Use a custom configuration file previously uploaded
sync:
    synchronise data: Synchronisation should be performed if time-series signals are time-shifted and/or recorded with different sampling rates. To synchronise and re-sample time series, library syncing is used.

    prompt: Load your synchronisation input file. Then click <b>Synchronise data</b>.
keys:
    load keys: "<b>For TA and TS use only</b>: upload the provided key files to encrypt the output of the CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS simulation and send it to the DICE3 server, as EU regulations 1152 and 1153/2017."
conf:
    description: The configuration file (.yaml) is used to overwrite the default variables of the physical model.
    usage: 'You can use the configuration file only in <b>engineering mode</b>. Choose and upload a new configuration file for the Run CO<sub>2</sub>MPAS procedure.
        <p>How to use it:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>download the template (click <a id="template-link" href="/conf/template">here</a>). This step is necessary only if you do not already have a valid configuration file</li>
        <li>modify it according to your parameters.</li>
        <li>upload it by pressing choose a configuration file. NB your file will be rewritten every time you upload a new one, and it will always be named conf.yaml</li>
        <li>flag the checkbox <b>use custom configuration file</b> under Advanced options in Run simulation. Please note that the checkbox is only available if the configuration file has been successfully uploaded.</li>

        <br/>
        <p><strong>N.B.</strong> conf.yaml works ONLY in <b>engineering mode</b>.</p>'
