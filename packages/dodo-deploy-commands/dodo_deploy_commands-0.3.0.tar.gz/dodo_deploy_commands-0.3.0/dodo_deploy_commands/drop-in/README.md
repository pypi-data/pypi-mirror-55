********************************
Drop-in for dodo_deploy_commands
********************************

To use the dropped in configuration call ``dodo layer drops/dodo_deploy_commands/drop on``. Depending on whether ansible and/or salt are used in your project, you may want to remove 'ansible-deploy' and/or 'salt-deploy' from the drop.on.yaml file that is dropped in.
