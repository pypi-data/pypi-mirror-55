important notes:
   - The field 'score' is the total score including possible torsion, sas and intramolecular contributions.
   - The 'PCS'(per_contact_score) is the score divided by the number of atom-atom-interactions having any
      contribution to the total score (number of contacts within 6A). (Do not confuse with a per atom score.)
   - The 'tors_score' is the sum of scores for each bond. A single bond B--C can have more than one
      torsions (A1--B--C--D1, A2--B--C--D1, ...). The score for a single bond is the mean of its
      possible torsions.
   - The 'sas_score' is the solvent accessable surface score for solvation/desolvation contributions.
   - The 'hb_score' is the hydrogen bond score for h-bond angle contributions.
