Utilities for navigating flat trees
-----------------------------------

From `The Dat Protocol`_:

    Flat Trees are the core data structure that power Dat's Hypercore feeds. They
    allow us to deterministically represent a tree structure as a vector. This is
    particularly useful because vectors map elegantly to disk and memory.

    Because Flat Trees are deterministic and pre-computed, there is no overhead
    to using them. In effect this means that Flat Trees are a specific way of
    indexing into a vector more than they are their own data structure. This makes
    them uniquely efficient and convenient to implement in a wide range of
    languages.

Part of the `DatPy`_ project.
