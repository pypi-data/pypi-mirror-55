            Flat Trees are the core data structure that power Dat's Hypercore feeds. They
            allow us to deterministically represent a tree structure as a vector. This is
            particularly useful because vectors map elegantly to disk and memory.
        
            Because Flat Trees are deterministic and pre-computed, there is no overhead
            to using them. In effect this means that Flat Trees are a specific way of
            indexing into a vector more than they are their own data structure. This makes
            them uniquely efficient and convenient to implement in a wide range of
            languages.
