        LayeredConfig compiles configuration from files, environment
        variables, command line arguments, hard-coded default values, or other
        backends, and makes it available to your code in a simple way::
        
            from layeredconfig import (LayeredConfig, Defaults, INIFile,
                                       Environment, Commandline)
            
            # This represents four different way of specifying the value of the
            # configuration option "hello":
            
            # 1. hard-coded defaults
            defaults = {"hello": "is it me you're looking for?"}
            
            # 2. INI configuration file
            with open("myapp.ini", "w") as fp:
                fp.write("""
            [__root__]
            hello = kitty
            """)
            
            # 3. enironment variables
            import os
            os.environ['MYAPP_HELLO'] = 'goodbye'
            
            # 4.command-line arguments
            import sys
            sys.argv = ['./myapp.py', '--hello=world']
            
            # Create a config object that gets settings from these four
            # sources.
            config = LayeredConfig(Defaults(defaults),
                                   INIFile("myapp.ini"),
                                   Environment(prefix="MYAPP_"),
                                   Commandline())
            
            # Prints "Hello world!", i.e the value provided by command-line
            # arguments. Latter sources take precedence over earlier sources.
            print("Hello %s!" % config.hello)
        
        * A flexible system makes it possible to specify the sources of
          configuration information, including which source takes
          precedence. Implementations of many common sources are included and
          there is a API for writing new ones.
        * Included configuration sources for INI files, YAML files, JSON file,
          PList files, etcd stores (read-write), Python source files,
          hard-coded defaults, command line options, environment variables
          (read-only).
        * Configuration can include subsections
          (ie. ``config.downloading.refresh``) and if a
          subsection does not contain a requested setting, it can optionally
          be fetched from the main configuration (if ``config.module.retry``
          is missing, ``config.retry`` can be used instead).
        * Configuration settings can be changed by your code (i.e. to update a
          "lastmodified" setting or similar), and changes can be persisted
          (saved) to the backend of your choice.
        * Configuration settings are typed (ie. if a setting should contain a
          date, it's made available to your code as a
          ``datetime.date`` object, not a ``str``). If
          settings are fetched from backends that do not themselves provide
          typed data (ie. environment variables, which by themselves are
          strings only), a system for type coercion makes it possible to
          specify how data should be converted.
        
        
        
        
        
        History
        =======
        
        0.3.3 (2019-11-11)
        ------------------
        
        * INIFile has been extended to support nested subsections.
        * Fixed a problem with DictSource (and by extension the Defaults
          source) where nested sections could be erroneously handled.
        * The sectionsep parameter to the Environment constructor has been
          documented. Thanks to @brentmclark for the patch!
        * Using "_" in the name of a configuration setting was not supported,
          regardless of what sectionsep had been set to. Thanks to @dginzbourg
          for reporting this!
        * Support for python 3.3 and 2.6 was dropped.
         
        
        0.3.2 (2016-09-26)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed bug #9 (Custom section separators caused values to be
          retrieved as lists, not single values). Thanks to @numbnut for
          reporting this!
        
        0.3.1 (2016-08-31)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed bug #8 (layering a Commandline source over a YAMLFile with
          defined subsection resulted in crash in initialization. Thanks to
          @AnsonT for reporting this!
        * The default URI used for EtcdStore was changed to reflect that port
          2379 should be used instead of 4001 (which was the default for etcd
          1.*).
        * Support for Python 3.2 was dropped.
        
        0.3.0 (2016-08-06)
        ------------------
        
        * New staticmethod ``dump``, which returns the content of the passed
          config object as a dict. This is also used as a printable
          representation of a config object (through ``__repr__``).
        * The intrinsic type of any typed setting may not be None any longer.
        * If you subclass LayeredConfig, any created subsection will be
          instances of your subclass, not the base LayeredConfig class
        * Layering multiple configuration files now works even when earlier
          files might lack subsections present in latter.
        
        All of the above was done by @jedipi. Many thanks!
        
        A number of unreported bugs, mostly concerning unicode handling and
        type conversion in various sources, was also fixed.
        
        0.2.2 (2016-01-24)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed a bug when using a class in a Default configuration for
          automatic coercion, where the type of the class isn't type (as is
          the case with the "newint" and other classes from the future
          module).
        
        * Fixed a bug where loading configuration from multiple config files
          would crash if latter configs lacked subsections present in
          earlier. Thanks to @badkapitan!
        
        0.2.1 (2014-11-26)
        ------------------
        
        * Made the Commandline source interact better with "partially
          configured" ArgumentParser objects (parsers that has been configured
          with some, but not all, possible arguments).
        
        0.2.0 (2014-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Integration with argparse: The Commandline source now accepts an
          optional parse parameter, which should be a configured
          argparse.ArgumentParser object. Most features of argparse, such as
          specifying the type of arguments, and automatic help text
        * A new source, PyFile, for reading configuration from python source
          files.
        * Another new source, EtcdStore, for reading configuration from etcd
          stores.
        
        0.1.0 (2014-11-03)
        ------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.
