# Sudoku as puzzle

Yet another Sudoku, treated as puzzle and using custom numbering script.

This project started as a replacement (*for my own pass-free-time*)
when Gnome adopted a Sudoku that obscures cells when clicked,
making impossible to have a clear view. Numbers were also much smaller then it
should be and the size of a minimum board was a really big one.
Since Gnome is international, my thought was also to make it available
for people that are more used to their numbering system.

## Preferences

Most Sudoku flavors trait the game as a 
[magic square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square).
This one traits it also as a puzzle and it is highly customizable.

### Numbering script

Apart from basic numbering script this package offers the ability to use either
the basic script:
* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

or one of the defaults provided:

* ancient Greek numbers
* Arabic numbers
* Chinese numbers
* Persian numbers
* Tibetan numbers
* custom numbers (by default same as basic numbers)

You can use any «*script*» you like, as long as the script consists, in Unicode,
of only one character for every number, by selecting "custom" and changing
the characters.

### «Pieces of the puzzle»

You can customize the existence of a side bar containing
the «*remaining pieces*». These are the numbers that remain to be placed
on the *magic square*, in order to fill the puzzle.

### Colors

You can customize most of the colors used in the board.

Currently:
* Background of an editable cell.
* Background of an editable cell, if selected.
* Background of a non editable cell.
* Background of a non editable cell, if selected.
* Foreground color for number if it is not valid.

And also
* Picker background

### Fonts

All installed fonts are supported.

A ratio for the font can be customized from 0.4 to 1.0. This ratio is the ratio
of the height of character to the height of the cell.

**Warning!** If font specified and saved in configuration file does no longer
exist in the system, Pango will replace it with something probably
(*but not sure*) compatible.

## How to play
The game is a classic Sudoku game. Fill empty cells in a way that no duplicate
numbers exist in any row, column or in any of the 9 sub-squares.

#### Place or change a number
There are three ways to place a number in the "board":
1. Move using the arrows to a cell and press the key that responds to the
character you want. If you selected the basic script then you should press
any number from 1 to 9.
2. Click on a cell and a "picker window" will appear.
3. Grab a number from the side bar and drop it in the cell you want.

#### Remove a number
If you want to empty a cell:
- you can go to that cell and press the «Backspace» or the «Delete» key.
- you can click on that cell, in order to show the «picker window»,
and then right click on it.
- drag the «clear icon» from the side bar to the cell.

### Picker window
Picker window will appear inside the clicked cell (if cell is editable)
and will make it current cell. 

#### Mouse clicks
- Clicking (left-click) on a number will change current cell
to that character-number.
- Clicking anywhere outside picker will close it.
- Right clicking will empty current cell and close the picker window.

#### Keystrokes
- Any key that responds to a character used in the numeric system
will hide the picker and change the cell to that character-number.
- Escape will close the picker and will not change current cell content.
- Backspace and Delete keys will empty current cell and close the picker window.

### Key shortcuts
#### Start screen
- Ctrl+c: continue previous game (if anyone started and was not solved).
- Ctrl+n: start a new game.
- Ctrl+o: opens options screen.
- Ctrl+q: quit application.

#### Game screen
- Alt+t: show-hide time passed.
- Ctrl+h: return to start screen (will save current game).
- Ctrl+q: same as Ctrl+h.
- Ctrl+y: redo a move (if applicable).
- Ctrl+z: undo a move (if applicable).

#### Options screen
- Ctrl+h: return to start screen (will not save current options).
- Ctrl+p: preview current options.
- Ctrl+q: same as Ctrl+h.
- Ctrl+s: save current options.

## Installation
### Requirements
- [qqwing](https://github.com/stephenostermiller/qqwing) must be installed
in the system.

Most Linux distributions provide a way to install it through their
main packaging system.

- Gtk >= 3.18 is needed to run the game. It should be preinstalled
in your system.

### pip
#### install
```sh
pip3 install 'sudokuaspuzzle'
```
#### upgrade
```sh
pip3 install 'sudokuaspuzzle>=0.1.24' --upgrade
```

## How to start application
Currently this package does not provide ways of running the game other
than the command line. Pip installation also installs the `sudokuaspuzzle`
«binary». So just type  `sudokuaspuzzle` in a terminal.

## TODO
Change appearance (both of the icon and the board) while dragging
a number or the clear icon.
