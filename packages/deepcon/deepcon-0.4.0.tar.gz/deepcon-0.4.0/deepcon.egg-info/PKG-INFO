Description: # Deepcon-package
        Python package for the DEEPCON contact prediction tool at https://github.com/ba-lab/DEEPCON
        
        ## How to install DEEPCON package?
        ```bash
        pip3 install deepcon
        ```
        ## How to test DEEPCON package?
        ```bash
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ba-lab/deepcon-package/master/deepcon/test/1a0tP0.aln
        ```
        ```bash
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ba-lab/deepcon-package/master/deepcon/weights-rdd-covariance.hdf5
        ```
        ```bash
        python3
        ```
        ```python
        import deepcon
        from deepcon import deepconcovariance
        deepconcovariance.main("1a0tP0.aln","1a0tP0.rr")
        ```
        To print the contact map as image, add the image name as the last parameter (optional)
        ```
        deepconcovariance.main("1a0tP0.aln","1a0tP0.rr", "1a0tP0.png")
        ```
        Example contact map as an image:
        ![](1a0tP0.png)
