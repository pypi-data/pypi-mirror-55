Description: 
        This repository is intended to offer some common augmentataion functions in computer vision task base on opencv. The functions' prototype comes from FAIR's maskrcnn-benchmark. I tried my best to implement these functions strictly follow the details of torchvision and pillow. Any discussions are welcomed.
