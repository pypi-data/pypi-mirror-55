TestCase: create posts in WBS-Elements ( create a first post % direct answer for every wbs-level )
        - this is a simple automation for filling the C-BOARD with posts (useful for developing a new styling)" )
        - this test is not available within the default setup-tests (in most cases, it is not useful)
WalkThrough:
 1. login as Super Admin / User-Number-One
 2. Go to the threadview.php of the wbs-element by clicking its default-ini-thread
 3. Make a post
 4. Create a direct answer for that post
 5. iterate 2,3,4 through all levels of the default ini-threads

     L1 element = Project-Level (the project name & purpose) ist the form prior the wbscreator:
 1."Automated Testing-Show" -> "A state-of-the-art test- and example walkthrough is performed"

     L2 elements:
 1.2 "Test Layout & Design" -> "Testing framework is selected and a draft is created"

     L3 elements:
 1.2.1 "Page Object Model" -> "First Page-Classes and Page-TestCases are ready to run"

     L4 element:
 1.2.1.1 "Test Management" -> "Testing work and workflow is well integrated (ci)"

     L5 element:
 1.2.1.1.1 "Continuous Integration of QA" -> "QA & Testing-Tasks are well integrated into the development cycle"

     L6 element:
 1.2.1.1.1.1 "CI Tools Selection Concepts" -> "A set of concepts for selcting CI-tools is selected"

     L7 element:
 1.2.1.1.1.1.1 "CI tools portfolio & workflow" -> "A set of CI-tools is available & test-automation is triggered automatically"


Requires to work:
 1. An installed instance of the CCS, manually installed or via docker (your "$docker-compose up --build")
 2. Via pytest or manually performed the RunSetups/ test_ini_1 - test_ini_4 setup scripts
 3. Via pytest ran the test_loginCreateProjectCreateWBS.py (for generating the wbs-elements with its initial-threads)

Better understanding for man AND machine is the result.
The communication-data collected from your digital-workplace-solution - combined with the data of your ERP-system is the biggest source of data-creation available.
        
If data is the new oil, then storing and further processing of this data is of crucial importance and will be the basis of:
     + ai-backed project-forecasting & suggestions for optimizations long before problems do occur,
    + ai-backed assignment of tasks and roles with the globally available human resources,
    + ai-provided suggestions of solutions found in prior projects containing tasks with a comparable problem and context.

As a result, our most precious resource, the human resource, can be utilized within the optimal level of its means:
    + Not too high - and not too low, on an individual scope,
    + Always supplying the worker with tasks containing a well balanced mix of learning and production.
        
Based on the continuous monitoring of communication (CCS) & the stage of completion of the deliverables (ERP),
the ai is capable to evaluate and in making suggestions and hints for 
    + Enabling a steady improvement of the workers skills,
    + Improving the productivity in general.
              
A high quality source of data and a global network of knowledge-workers will be the biggest source of competitive advantage. That is what the CCS was made for: Helping you to develop a CYbernetic COllaboration NETwork by delivering well-structured, context-enriched data.
